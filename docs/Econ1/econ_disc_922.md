Producer surplus  $P=MC$ 
Consumer surplus $MB-P$ 

Marginal benefit cannot be quantified solely by the ability to pay.
- The marginal benefit is directly drawing from the utility
- Utility is abstract -> it doesn't actually exist
	- Completely subjective, utility and benefit doesn't actaully exist

Producer surplus 
 $$=\frac{Q_t\times P_t}{2}$$
Consumer surplus  $$=\frac{Q_t \times (P_{max}-P_t)}{2}$$

Tax revenue
$$=(P_d - P_s)\times Q_t$$
Deadweight loss 
$$ = \frac{(Q_e - Q_t)\times (P_d-P_s)}{2}$$

Where $Q_t =$  Quantity transacted 
$P_{max} =$ highest willingness to pay for a good or service by any given consumer
$P_t =$ Equilibrium price at which the good was transacted.
$P_d=$ Price paid by consumers
$P_s=$ Price received by suppliers

Based on the graph, we see that 
- Ripple rock will supply approximately 300 thousand pounds of tilapia
- The fishing company has larger supply due to lower marginal cost, and will produce 600 thousand pounds of tilapia at price point $2.25
