**Unemployment**: A person who is willing and able to work, actively looking for work, but who are not employed
**U-Rate: Unemployment rate.** The share of labour force who are unemployed
**Example:**
When lawyer gets fired from his $200,000 dollar lawyer job to work in Mcdonalds, we see that the **U-rate** doesn't take this into account. 

**How can Unemployment exist?**
- In most markets **supply=demand**
- If there is unemployment, it means that **labor supply>labor demand**
- How can this be? Unemployment arises when **labour demand** is **weak** 

**Types of Unemployment**
- **Frictional** 
	- Occurs when workers spend time searching for the jobs that best suit their skills
	- The economy is always changing, so some frictional unemployment is inevitable
	- This type of unemployment is short-term
	- Unemployment insurance and other income support increase frictional unemployment
- **Structural**
	- Structural unemployemnt occurs when wages are unable to fall to the market-clearing wage. This creates labour surplus
	- In well-functioning labor market, equilibrium occurs where labor supply equals labor demand and no structural unemployment exists. 
- **Cyclical**

	- When wages can easily adjust to market conditions, equilibrium occurs at the **market-clearing** wage, where the **labor-supply curve** meets the **labor demand curve** and there is no unemployment
	- Sometimes,, the **bargained wage** gets stuck above the **market-clearing wage**
	- As a result, there's a persistent gap between the **supply** of labor and the **demand** for it. This causes **structural unemployemnt**
**Causes of Structural Unemployment**
1. Unions keep wages high for some workers.
2. Job protection regulations make it hard to fire workers.
	1. Therefore, Businesses are **reluctant** to hire new workers.
3. Minimum wage laws prevent wages from falling to the market-clearing wage
	1. ==Not really a great source of structural unemployment== - Conclusion by nobel prize winner
	2. Changes in minimum wage found similar unemployment. This happenes only in small changes in minimum wages. 
4. Efficiency wages (higher wage paid to encourage greater worker productivity)
**Bottom Line**
Frictional unemployment occurs when there ar

Structural unemployment occurs when there are not enough jobs for everyone.
