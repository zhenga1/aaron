A sizable literature has examined households’WTP for efficiency improvements in HICs (e.g., Hausman 1979; Busse, Knittel, and Zettelmeyer 2013;  Greene, Evans, and Hiestand 2013). However, these empirical findings may not apply to contexts that have different income levels, consumer preferences, and other factors.

Compact Fluorescent Lights (CFLs)

Notably, the comparison indicates that respondents’maximum WTP for CFLs (250 KGS) is below the most conservative empirical estimate of the discounted private returns on investment (268 KGS). These findings suggest that there is a sizable “efficiency gap” between consumer valuation and estimated returns on the energy efficient technology. The evidence also suggests that insufficient information on the benefits from efficient lighting could suppress household demand in this context.

Electric power transmission and distribution sector losses are substantial in LMICs, averaging 18.4 percent in low-income countries and 10.3 percent in middle-income countries in 2014. Distribution sector losses include metering inefficiencies, billing inefficiencies, and electricity theft. Consumers who are not metered, do not receive bills, or have little incentive to pay the bills that they receive may pay a fraction of what it costs to supply the energy they  
consume. These various forms of revenue collection inefficiency confer an implicit subsidy that can further reduce WTP for energy efficiency improvements.

Ideally, energy efficiency policies and programs would be tailored to the political and institutional context in which they are being implemented. Although the value added by energy efficiency policy intervention in LMIC settings is potentially large, so too are the implementation challenges (Singh, Sant, and Chunekar 2012). For example, a limited capacity to raise revenue constrains a government’s ability to finance energy efficiency subsidies, tax incentives, and other programs that are commonly deployed in HICs. Limited resources and governance challenges can also limit the effectiveness of building codes and appliance standards, which require enforcement and program oversight.

The **Unnat Jyoti by Affordable LEDs for All (UJALA)** program was designed to sustain markets for energy efficiency and significantly reduce the energy costs paid by Indian consumers.
UJALA targets lighting, which accounts for an estimated 18–27 percent of total residential electricity consumption in India (Chunekar, Mulay, and Kelkar 2017), and seeks to increase sales of LED bulbs. Although energy savings over the life of the technology easily offset the additional up-front cost of LED bulbs before the UJALA program was introduced, adoption of efficient lighting remained low.

Empirical analyses of the economic impacts of energy efficiency improvements typically em-  
phasize reductions in energy consumption and expenditures, associated reductions in emis-  
sions (e.g., reduced pollution from electric power plants), and, to a lesser extent, the welfare  
gains associated with demand rebound (see, e.g., Allcott and Greenstone 2017). These are the  
main sources of benefits from energy efficiency investments in HICs. However, in LMICs,  
other types of benefits could be important, and failure to account for them will underestimate  
the social value of energy efficiency improvements. We focus here on three potential sources of benefits: enhanced access to energy services, local health impacts, and improvements in  
industrial productivity.

On the benefits side, lower carbon emissions and  we posit that energy efficiency investments could also generate indirect benefits such as improved reliability, enhanced energy access, and increased  
productivity.
