**Inflation**
**Inflation** is a rise in the overall level of prices
Over time, inflation erodes the purchasing power of money.

**How is inflation measured?**
The **consumer price index** (CPI) is an index that measures how expensive goods are relative to other goods. 

# CPI Construction -- 1
*Find out what people typically buy*
Housing usually has the largest weight

Housing has the largest weight, but is still **not the majority**

# CPI Construction - 2
Collect prices from jthe stores where people do their shopping
Then tally up the price of the basket of goods and services

The CPI is a weighted average of the prices of all goods
The weights reflect the share of each goods in the basket.

Sometimes, governments would **fudge data** to make the CPI look better 

**Inflation rate:** the percentage increase in the CPI

**External Shocks** are always the things that are causing the inflation.

**Challenges with Measurement**
- Quality improvements can hide price decreases
	- Example; computers
	- So inflation may be actually overreported 
- You can save yourself money by switching towards cheaper alternatives
	- **Substitution bias:** The overstating of inflation occurs because people substitute towards goods whose prices rise by less
	- So essentially the problem of inflation can be miscalculated or underestimated
**Comparing Dollars over Time**
How do we compare monetary values over time when prices are changing?

Today's $ = Another times $ $\times$ Price Level tdy / Price level over time
**EX:**
 CPI toay is 295, CPI in 2000 was 192.

**Real and Nominal Varible**
A variable measured in dollars is a **nominal variable**
A variable that has been adjusted to account for inflation is a **real variable**

**Exampels of when you should focus on real variables**
Real variables should be used to make most decisions.

**Real Wage Increase**:
- Pay rate increase (%) - Inflation rate ()

**Example:**
- The hourly wage for waiters in Berkeley has increased 6% over the last year.
- But inflation is around 8.5%
- Inflation is less than pay rate, so waiters are actually **worse off**

1. To analyze whether you are becoming better paid (real wage)

**Example 2:**
- Yesterday NYT reported Amazon posted $127 bln in sales for third quarter, up 8 percent from year earlier, showing inflation has not plummeted consumer spending. 
- What's wrong with this statement?

Answer: real sales growth: 8%-8.5% = -0.5%
Consumers are actually buying less

**Real and Nominal Interest Rates**
The stated interest rate without corrrection for the effects of inflation is a **nominal interest rate**

the interest rate in terms of changes in purchasing power is the **real interest rate**

Real rate = Nominal rate - Inflation rate
What is the real interest rate?

$2.5-8.5 = -6$%
You are paying banks to lend them money.

# Money Illusion
**Money Illusion:** The (mistaken) tendency to focus on nominal dollar amounts instead of inflation-adjusted amounts.

Money illusion is a problem because it can:
- distort prices
- Lead to mispricing
- Create nominal wage rigidity

**Important exmaple: Nominal wage rigidity**: The reluctance to cut nominal wages

# Costs of Inflation
Overtime, inflation 

# Costs of Hyperinflation
**Hyperinflation** is an extremely high rate of inflation.

Hyperinflation is extreme example.

**Some inflation** in economy is normal.

Costs associated with expeted inflation include:
- **Menu costs**
- Shoe Leather costs
	- Someone may want to minimise the amount of dollars they keep in cash.
# Costs of Unexpected Inflation
Sometimes inflation is not anticipated
Costs associated with unexpected inflation include the following:
- Confusing the signals that prices send
- Redistributing income
