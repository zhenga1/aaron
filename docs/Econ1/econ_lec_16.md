# Sources of Inflation
*Inflation = Demand-pull inflation + Cost-push inflation + Expected inflation.*
**Demand-pull inflation:** inflation resulting from excess demand.
**Cost-push inflation** inflation that results from unexpected rise in production costs. Increase in producction costs -> increase in inflation
**Inflation expectations** the rate at which average prices are antcipated to rise next ear. increase in expectations -> increase in inflation

**Q:** U.S and European countries ban import of Russian oil.
**Result:** Cost-push inflation will rise. 

# Inflation Expectations
- High-inflation countries are stuck in a vicious cycle
	- High inflation -> high inflation expectations -> high inflation
- Low-inflation countries enjoy a virtuous cycle:
	- Low inflation -> low inflation expectations -> low inflation
- In the long-run, the key to persistent low inflation is to convince people that inflation is going to be low (for some time)

# Measuring Inflation Expectations

There are three methods for meausring inflation expectations:
- Survey of consumers
- Surveys and forecasts of economists
- Financial Markets

# Output Gap and Inflation
1) A **positive output gap** drives inflation to rise above inflation expectations
A strong economy increases the demand for goods and services => the quantity demnaded exceeds the quantity supplied => excess demand => output gap is positive => prices increase.

This is demand-pull inflation; excess demand leads inflation to rise above inflation expectations.

If demand is insufficient and the output gap is negative -> opposite effect: prices fall

# Philips curve and Unexpected inflation

The **philips curve** illustrates the link between output gap and unexpeced inflation

**Unexpected inflation** is the difference beetween inflation and inflation expectation.

Uber’s surge-pricing algorithm has kicked in. It’s like a turbo-charged Phillips curve, programmed to respond to excess demand by raising prices immediately. We say it’s turbo-charged because it usually takes other businesses months rather than minutes to change their prices in response to a surge in demand. That’s why the Phillips curve typically describes inflation rising or falling over a period of months.

There’s one important difference. During that brief post-concert surge, most other prices—the price of taxis, of buses, or even of rental cars—are unchanged. As such, Uber’s surge pricing is best viewed as a change in relative prices—it raises the price of taking an Uber relative to taking the bus. By contrast, the Phillips curve describes how a surge in demand across the whole economy leads many businesses to raise their prices, and these widespread price rises create inflation

# Labor market philips curve
The **labor market philips curve** links unexpected inflation to the unemployment rate(rather than the output gap)

Reduction in unemployment rate --> increase in unexpected inflation

In this version, inflation is stable at the *equilibrium unemployment rate*.

**Unanticipated inflation** is generally bad, there are the thing called **shoe-leather cost** and **menu costs**.
