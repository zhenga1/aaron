# **Business Cycle**
**Business Cycles** are short-term flunctuations in eocnomic activity. 

In some years, the **economy** is too weak 
=> High unemployment, low income and low wages

**Grey areas above**: These are areas of recessions
Sometimes, the economy is too good, which leads to **inflationary pressures**, i.e. **inflation**.

**Objectives of the Chapter and Next 4 chapters**
- Chapter 31 - 34 or Chapter 30-33

**ISMP Model**

**Aggregate Expenditure**
**Aggregate Expenditure** ist he total amount of goods and services that people want to buy across the whole economy
$$AE = C+I+G+NX$$
$C$ = Consumption
	Someone buying something
	- You buying new cellphone
	- Me buying something
	- etc
$I$ = Investment
$G$ = Government Expenditures
$NX$ = Net export

In a sense, the **Aggregate Expenditure** is basically just the aggregate demand.

**Net Export = Export revenue - Import revenue**

**Short-Run vs Long-Run Drivers**
In the **short-run**, actual GDP may fail to meet potential output

When actual GDP is greater than potential, the economy will overheat.
The output gap: the difference between actual and potential output. 

# The Output Gap
- A **negative output gap** occurs whne actual output is below its potential: there are idle resources, and it typically corresponds with high unemployment.
	- dot com boom is an example of negative output gap, as it is reccession.
- A **positive output gap** mean actual output is above potential output: the economy is using its resources with intensity.
	- So this provides inflationary pressure, all the resources of the economy is being utilised more than possible. The result of this is inflationary pressure, which raises the prices to partition consumption(i.e., makes it so that some members of the economy is unable to consume)

# Macroeconomic Equilibrium
**IS Curve**
The IS Curve reflects the influence of real interest rates on aggregate expenditures

The real interest rate:
- May be the most important price in the economy.
- It determines this year's aggregate expenditure
- Is a lever policy makers use to influence the economy

# Interest Rates => Consumption
Lower interest rates boost consumption
Examples:
- Car purchases
- Credit card purchases
- House purchases

**Mortgage interest rate** = 7%, which incredibly discourages consumption of   (say) buying houses.

# Interest Rates => investment
Lower interest rates boost investment

Intuition: Firms often finance investments using loans from banks

When interest rates are low: loans are cheaper => more investment

# Interest Rate => Government expenditure
Lower interest rates boost G

Lower interest rates lower the costs faced b the federal government of interest payments for existing government debt
=> More money available for G (roads, procurement, military expenditures, etc)

# Interest Rate => Net Exports
Lower interest rates boost net exports.

Lower interest rates lower the exchange rate of the dollar
=> This makes US export cheaper for our trading partners. => More exports

It also makes import of foreign goods more expensive for US consumers => Less imports.

Higher interest rate -> more valuable currency, higher demand for the currency, higher exchange rae

Lower interest rate -> Less valuable currency, less demand for the currency, less exchange rate.

The IS Curve illustrates hwo lower interest rates raise spending and hence GDP, leading to a more positive output gap

# The MP Curve

The MP curve describes the real interest rate, which reflects 

**MP Curve**
- The federal funds rate, set by the Fed, is effectively a risk-free interest rate
- The MP curve illustrates the real interest rate
- The real interest rate reflects the risk-free interest rate and the risk premium

# The Fed sets the interest rate
- The process of setting interest rates in an effort to influence economic conditions is called **monetary policy**.
- In the United States, the *Federal Reserve executes monetary policy*
- The Fed sets the federal funds rate to influence the real interest rate

**Risk free interest rate**
- What the U.S Government pays when they issue their debt (since the U.S government is generally perceived to be ***credible***)

**Risk Premium interest rate**
- What every person is charged **extra** for to borrow money. 

**Next Time:** - Using IS-MP Framework to understand Economic Conditions
- IS curve illustrates how output gap depends on real interest rate
- MP curve shows what real interest rate will be
- Putting them together priovides model to understand state of economy.
