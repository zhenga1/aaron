Flexible:
- Doesn't dictate who reduces(by how much), just sets the overall target
Effective:
- Marginal costs *equalized*

Abatement costs revealed:
- Market price

**What are "market based" performance standards**
- Benchmark emission are set
	- per unit of *output*
![[Zoom_ukscS2PlX9.png]]
- Output-refudned emission tax
	- Swedish NOx tax
![[Zoom_gT70iDtJqH.png]]

**First principles for emission pricing**
- In first principles, we learnt that optimal emissions price equals the marginal damage
![[Zoom_JBr3X5fIvP.png]]
- This can be implemented with taxes or the cap and trade system
- Marginal abatement costs are equalized
- (Lump sum) allocation doesn't affect equilibrium

Abatement:
- You abate as long as the the marginal cost of the abatement is lower than the taxation

So the purple area is the area of abatement, the cost of reducing(the carbon emissions) by a certain amount. 
The orange area is the carbon consumed by the firm, representing the area of the carbon multiplied by the taxation (carbon)
**Carbon pricing and cost to industry with benchmarking**

# OBR(Output based rebating)
**OBR affects market equilibrium**
- Combines price on emission with subsidy to output(benchmark allocation)
- Compared to lump-sumallocation:
	- smaller output price increase from regulation
	- Less output substitution
![[Zoom_2iF6hjdjEV 1.png]]

**OBR can be efficiency enhancing **
- When the regulation would otherwise be insufficinetly stringent
	- Political feasibility
- When it reduces interactions with other market failures

**Legitimate concerns about pricing embodied carbon fully**
- Carbon Leakage
	- Energy-intensive trade-exposed sectors are limited in their abilitiy to pass on costs
- Ways of implemeting trade barriers to make sure that  stringent carbon tax measures are implemented, not giving firms, for example, the option of simply producing (carbon) overseas and evading standards.

**Market-based Clean Performance Standardds as Building Blocks for Carbon Pricing**

![[Zoom_m5389fSpB7 1.png]]

**Choose Sectors**
- OBR works best when applied to a sector where
1) emissions acan be readily measured, and 
2) products are relatively homogeneous
- Power sector if not otherwise covered

**Determine what benchmarks wanted**
- Emissions included
	- Direct+indirect emissions for electricity
	(if covered without rebating)
- Multiple benchmarks?
	- Yes for differentiated producers
	- Avoid for different processes
	- Seen in the Chinese trading system
