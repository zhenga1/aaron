Ikea sells millions of Billy bookcases each year to buyers all around the world. It sells so many of them because the Billy bookcase is so cheap. And the Billy bookcase is so cheap because Ikea sells so many of them. This virtuous cycle arises because of the benefits of mass production (which are sometimes called economies of scale).

When you’re producing millions of bookcases, you can invest in creating incredibly specialized production lines that are much more efficient. For instance, rather than hiring skilled woodworkers to make the Billy, Ikea has programmed specialized robots to do most of the work, and they can work 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. 

The **automated production line is so efficient that it makes a new bookcase every five seconds**. In addition, Ikea produces so much furniture that it’s one of the world’s largest purchasers of wood. This gives it substantial **bargaining power,** which it uses to demand cheaper wood, further lowering its input costs. Put it all together, and the opportunity cost of producing another bookcase is lower for Ikea than for any other business. These lower opportunity costs due to the benefits of mass production can be another enduring source of comparative advantage, particularly for large producers.

The gains to buyers from allowing imports exceed the losses to sellers. There’s a neat intuition underlying all of this. The main effect of imports is to lower the price of shirts, and if American producers wanted to, they could sell just as many shirts as before, just as American consumers could buy just as many as before. Indeed, if Americans didn’t change how many shirts they bought or produced, then the economic surplus gained by American buyers due to international trade lowering prices would exactly equal the economic surplus lost by American producers due to these lower prices. 

But when the price falls, American suppliers minimize their losses by supplying fewer cheap shirts, while American buyers amplify their gains by buying more cheap shirts, often from international sellers. (Imports fill the gap between the decreased production by American sellers and the increased purchases by American consumers.) 

The net effect is that the amplified gains to buyers outweigh the minimized losses to sellers, and so imports lead Americans—taken as a whole—to enjoy more economic surplus.

It’s time to summarize what we’ve learned about imports. It’s always best to start with what happens to the price. Cheap foreign competitors cause the price of goods we import to fall. Buyers respond by raising the quantity they demand, while sellers respond by reducing the quantity they supply, with imports filling the difference. The lower price increases the consumer surplus of buyers, and decreases the producer surplus of sellers. And because buyers amplify their gains and sellers minimize their losses, the net effect is for total economic surplus to increase.

Okay, that’s the effect of imports. Now it’s time to apply the same approach to analyzing the market for exports.

There are at least two ways to make cars. The first involves assembly lines in Detroit, where skilled manufacturing workers—assisted by plenty of robots—transform steel into General Motors cars. The second way is less well known, but perhaps more amazing: You can grow cars in Iowa.

Here’s how. Buy corn seeds, sow them, and water them. With enough care, you’ll soon have a field full of corn. Harvest this corn, and put it on a boat headed into the Pacific Ocean. Wait a few months, and the ship will return with Toyotas. Now just drive those cars off the boat. Voila! You’ve harvested a crop of cars that you grew from seeds. The fact that this happened because the cargo ship stopped in Japan to trade corn for cars is beside the point. The cars were the direct result of the efforts of farmers in Iowa.

Both of these methods of making cars employ plenty of American workers—in one case, it’s manufacturing workers in Detroit; in the other, it’s farm workers in Iowa. And they each produce high-quality cars. So why would we prefer one approach to the other? This question is central to the trade debate, because when people argue for protecting American industries from international competition, they’re effectively arguing that we should build cars in Detroit, and stop growing them in Iowa. But that’s inefficient. 

When there are different ways to make something, we typically let different producers compete with each other, letting buyers choose to buy from the lowest-cost producer. But if we force Americans to buy Detroit-made cars, even if it’s cheaper to grow them in Iowa, then we’ll end up paying more for our cars. This efficiency loss is a major reason not to limit international trade.

Free trade in the solar system?
Despite this, many people still argue that international trade is “unfair.” For instance, some say that it is unfair for American workers to compete with China, because workers there are paid less than one-twentieth American wages. And they say it’s unfair that America buys more from China than China buys from us. The Alliance for American Manufacturing made these arguments in a letter to The New York Times, shown in the left column, below. Presumably, it is hoping these arguments will convince the government to reduce Chinese imports into the United States.

One way to assess the validity of an argument is to consider its implications in an analogous setting. The right column shows an analogous letter that we imagined the American light-bulb manufacturers might write, complaining about the cheap imports of light, not from another country, but from even further away—from the Sun!


The letter from Alliance for American Manufacturing reads, To the Editor: No thoughtful discussion about the impact of trade on workers, consumers, and America’s economic future can take place without recognition of the role that China plays in today’s global marketplace.

While many factors affect employment and wages in the United States, it’s wrong to minimize or dismiss the role of trade, especially with China. Our lopsided trade deficit with Beijing—256 billion dollars last year alone—highlights its market-distorting practices, including subsidies, dumping, currency manipulation, counterfeiting, and lax labor and environmental standards.

These unfair trade practices have cost 1.8 million American jobs since 2001, according to an Economic Policy Institute study. American consumers pay in other ways: unsafe and uninspected food, toys, and medication, and higher local taxes when factories close. Until we insist that China honor its commitments, American workers will continue to lose.

The letter from Alliance for Light-Bulb Manufacturing reads, To the Editor: No thoughtful discussion about the impact of trade on workers, consumers, and America’s economic future can take place without recognition of the role that the Sun plays in today’s global marketplace for light.

While many factors affect employment and wages in the United States, it’s wrong to minimize or dismiss the role of trade, especially with the Sun. Our lopsided trade deficit with the Sun is a big problem: We import all of our natural light from the Sun, while the Sun buys none of our products. The problem is market-distorting practices that allow the Sun to export light at an unfair price of 0 dollar. Also, the Sun has lax labor and environmental standards. (It has none.)

These unfair trade practices have cost American light-bulb manufacturers dearly. If we all used artificial light during the day instead of just at night, it would double employment in the industry. American consumers pay for sunlight in other ways: The sun causes cancer, it makes us hot during the summer, and it causes higher local taxes when light-bulb factories close.

The Alliance for American Manufacturing is hoping that its arguments will convince the government to ban or tax imports from China. Do you find its argument convincing? If so, why shouldn’t the (fake) Alliance for Light-Bulb Manufacturing also get similar protection? It’s easy to do—we could just require that buildings eliminate their windows to protect light-bulb manufacturers from the Sun’s “unfair” competition! That sounds absurd, but that’s sort of the point of this story.

Step one: What will the new price be? This tariff adds $4 to the trade costs of importers. Because the world price of $12 is fixed, importers have to pay the world price of $12 plus the tariff of $4. Therefore, the price of shirts rises by $4, to $16.
Step two: At this new price, what quantities will be demanded and supplied? Consult the domestic supply and demand curves to discover that at the new higher price, the quantity demanded by domestic buyers is lower, while the quantity supplied by domestic suppliers is higher.
Step three: What quantity will be traded? Recall that imports make up the gap between the quantities demanded and supplied. Because this gap shrinks, imports fall.
OK, so given these effects, who wins and who loses from a tariff?

Domestic buyers are unhappy because the higher price means they either pay an extra $4 per shirt or buy fewer shirts. Their consumer surplus is the area under the demand curve and above the price. Before the tariff, this was equal to the triangle made up of the areas A + B + C + D + E + F. After the tariff, this falls to area A + B. Thus, tariffs cause consumer surplus to fall by area C + D + E + F.

Domestic suppliers are happy because the higher price means higher profit margins on each shirt sold and they also sell an increased quantity. Producer surplus is the area above the supply curve and below the price. Without a tariff, this was area G. After the tariff, it is area C + G. Thus, tariffs cause producer surplus to rise by an amount equal to area C.

The government also gains because it collects $4 of revenue for each shirt imported. This total tax revenue is equal to the $4 tax (which is the height of rectangle E) times the total number of imports (the width of rectangle E). So the tariff yields tax revenue equal to the height times width—that is, the area of rectangle E.

Adding all this up, consumers lose C + D + E + F; producers gain C; and the government gains E. Hence, in total, a tariff will decrease the economic surplus of Americans by an amount equal to area D + F.

If you’re worried that Figure 9 looks complicated, don’t be. It’s really not so bad. The charts below show how we built this figure. We started by analyzing outcomes without a tariff. Then we analyzed the case with a tariff, tracking consumer surplus, producer surplus, and government revenue. Finally, we looked to see what changed.


The first graph is labeled no tariff. The area enclosed by the point of intersection of the domestic demand on the world price line and the world plus line is labeled as consumer plus. The area between the point of intersection of the domestic supply curve on the world price line to the point of origin of the domestic supply is labeled producer surplus.

The second graph is labeled with a 4-dollar tariff. A line is drawn parallel to the horizontal axis at a price value of 16 dollars. The area between the point of intersection of the domestic demand on world price with tariff line and the line itself is labeled consumer surplus. The area between the point of intersection of domestic supply on the world price with tariff line to the point of origin of domestic supply is labeled producer surplus.

The rectangular area between the point of intersection of the domestic supply with world price with tariff and the point of intersection of domestic demand to world price with tariff enclosed with world price curve is marked as Government revenue.

The third graph labeled Difference plots reduced economic surplus. The area between the point of intersection of domestic demand with world price along with tariff to the point of intersection of domestic demand with world price is labeled reduced economic surplus. The area between the point of intersection of domestic supply with world price along with tariff to the point of intersection of domestic supply with world price is also labeled reduced economic surplus.

And the end result is worth all this work. We’ve found that taxing goods made in other countries actually reduces the total economic surplus of Americans! If this is surprising, here’s the intuition: The extra government revenue isn’t really a gain, because it’s effectively paid by American consumers who now pay an extra $4 for each shirt they import. And so the tariff shifts money from one set of Americans (consumers) to another (the government). The tariff also raises the price of shirts, which distorts both the choices that consumers make (they’ll buy fewer shirts) and the choices that producers make (they keep producing even when it’s not efficient to do so).

Red tape is like a tariff because it raises costs, but it doesn’t even raise revenue.

Tariffs aren’t the only tool that governments use to reduce international trade. Consider what it takes to export a bicycle to Bujumbura, a city in Burundi where bikes are often used as taxis. Even once you’ve shipped that bike to the nearest port in Tanzania, it has to wait for 50 days of pre-arrival approvals, 8 days of port handling, 15 days to go through customs, and then a month on a train. Once the bike arrives at the border of Burundi, it then takes another 12 days to get through customs again, be loaded on a barge, and then go through customs again at Bujumbura port. The 124 days, 19 documents, and 55 signatures required to get a bike to Bujumbura aren’t just a headache; they add a lot to your trading costs.

Given all the red tape, it’s a miracle this bicycle ever made it to Burundi!

All this red tape ultimately has the same effect as a tariff—it increases trade costs and so raises the price of American-made bikes. The effects of this higher price is the same, whether it’s caused by tariffs or red tape: It reduces the quantity demanded, raises the quantity supplied by domestic sellers, and therefore reduces international trade. But red tape is more inefficient than a tariff, because it doesn’t even raise revenue for the government.

Import quotas have similar effects to tariffs, but don’t raise revenue.
Tariffs and red tape affect trade because they raise the price of foreign goods, reducing the quantity of international trade. However, setting an import quota would also have the same impact. An import quota limits the quantity of a good that can be imported. For instance, the $4 tariff on shirts in Figure 9 reduces imports to a quantity equal to the width of rectangle E. The government could achieve the exact same outcome—the same price and the same quantity demanded, supplied, and imported—if instead it imposed a quota limiting imports to this number. However with a quota, the government wouldn’t raise revenue the way it does with tariffs (unless it auctioned off the scarce import licenses).
