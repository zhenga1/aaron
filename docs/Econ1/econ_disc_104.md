And then a bunch of multi-part exams.

Tuesday's(10/4) Guest lecture is not going to be covered on the Midterm

Thursday's(10/6) guest lecture **may** be on the midterm

Today gonna cover chapter 10, which is the last (textbook) chapter we will cover before midterm

**Example**
*REDBULL MARKET*
![[EpicPen_Qxr0YYnL1I.png]]
We see that the private marginal cost is the marginal cost of, say, redbull making sludge.

To redbull firm, the marginal cost is likely just the marginal cost of the (metals, preservatives, food components) used in each marginal redbull. 

However, likely the redbull firm has a greater cost to society, since the production of each extra unit can produce environmental detriments to others. 

If we have that the private marginal cost is SPMC, then we must have that the social marginal cost is higher, so the supply curve is shifted upwards.

Externality: Goods and services whose production or consumption results in positive or negative spillover effects to third parties

Market produces at $(P_e,Q_e)$, but this is economically inefficient, since there are external costs to society not taken into account.

*Rational market* would decrease if $MSC > MSB$. 
However, this wouldn't happen because the firms are the decision makers in the free market. 

Corrective tax can help $MSC = MSB$, thus allowing society to achieve optimal levels of production.

Non-excludable good - Something you can't sell, something you can't stop people from consuming
Non-rivalrous good - Something that isn't
