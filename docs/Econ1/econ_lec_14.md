# Business Cycles
**Business Cycles** are short-temr flunctuations in economic activity

In some years, the economy is too weak
=> High unemployment, low income and low output

In other years, the economy is too hot
=> Low unemployment, high income but high inflation

**Objective of This Chapter and Next Four Chapters**

# ISMP Moddel
- The IS-MP model is tool to understand the business cycle
- The IS curve reflects influence fo real interest rates on aggregate expenditures
- The MP curve illustrates how monetary policy influences real interest rate

- The IS curve illustrates how output gap depends on real interest rate

The state of economy is determined by interaction fo IS curve and MP curve. 

$IS$ (Interest-Savings) curve is a diagram plotting Output gap (GDP - potential GDP) on $x$-axis, and Real interest rate on the y-axis.

$MP$ (Monetary Policy) is the curve denoting the real interest rate set by monetary policy and financial interests

# Flunctuating Demand and business cycles
- Aggregate expenditures play important role in determining macroeconomic equilibrium
- Recessions and expansions can be explained as declining and increasing expenditures
- We care about recessions and expansions because they determine *household income, level of unemployment* and *level of inflation*. 

**Booms and Busts**
Bouts of optimism and pessimism can drive the economy into booms and busts

1. The **optimistic IS curve** describes spending plans in good times when people are optimistic about their economic future
2. It leads to a **boom equilibrium** where output is at the potential level, validating people's optimism
3. But if people become **pessimistic** about the future, they'll cut back on how much they plan to spend at any given interest rate, and businesses respond by cutting production. This decreases in output at any given real interest rate **shifts IS curve to the left**
4. The economy shifts to **bust equilibrium**, where output declines to be less than potnential output. Since economic slump is equilibrium, it will persist if nothing changes.

# Economic Policy
- Can help stabilize the economy

# Monetary Policy
- The process of settings interest rates in an effort to influence economic conditiosn is called moneary policy
- In the US, the FED execues monetary policy by changing the real interest rate
- Monetary Policy shifts the MP curve
- The shift in MP curve leads to a new equilibrium.

We see that during a recessionary equilibrum, one thing FEDs can do to increase GDP, relative to potential GDP is to lower the interest rate. This will boost the incentive to spend of consumers. 

When the federal reserve cuts interest rates, it stimulates an increase in equilibrium GDP
1. In **recessionary equilibbrium**, GDP < Potential GDP
2. Cutting real interest rate causes MP curve to *shift down*. 
3. This leads the economy to shift to new equilibrium, *with higher GDP, eliminating the negative output gap*. 

Hard to get into FED since it has so much control of the market

# Current Monetary Policy
The MP curve shifts due to changes in moneetary policy or risk premium.
- At **initial equilibrium**, GDP is equal to Potential GDP
- An **increase in the real interest rate** causes the **MP curve to shift up**, leading to a new equilibrium with **lower GDP** and **a higher interest rate.**

- Increasing **Real interest rate** to **decrease the real output gap**

# Fiscal Policy
- The government can also influence economy through **fiscal policy**
- Fiscal policy involves government spending and taxes
- It's set by Congres and the President
- When the government adjusts fiscal policy, it shifts the IS curve. 

**The Multiplier Determines the Effectiveness of Fiscal Policy**
An increase in spending has a multiplied effect on aggregate expenditure.

The **multiplier** is a measure of how much GDP changes as a result of both the direct and indirect effects flowing from each extra dollar of spending.

$\Delta GDP = \Delta$ Spending $\times$ Multiplier

For example:
1) Govt gives poor mom 1 dollar
2) Poor mom spends 1 dollar on something
3) That something's producer increases in revenue by 1 dollar
4) So then that producer will likely spend a part of that dollar.

The **FED** is independent, they are made of economists

**Shoe-leather costs are the increased costs of transactions caused by inflation.**Â 
- The cost of people who are trying to minimise the impact of inflation on their monetary and physical assets
**Menu cost is the real cost of changing a listed price**.
- The cost of reprinting menus and price tags of different goods


Cagan defined a **hyperinflationary episode** as starting in the month that the ***monthly inflation rate exceeds 50%***, and as ending when the ***monthly inflation rate drops below 50%*** and stays that way for at least a year.
