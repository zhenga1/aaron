**Introduction**
So far, we have seen that : Markets are good way to organize economics activity
- In absence of *market failures*, market is efficient

Externalities arise when consumers or firms neglect *social costs* of their actions
- In this case, market is not efficient
- Government intervention(taxes and regulations) is needed

Example:
- Air pollution from factory
- CO2 from car
- Late-night steroe blasting from dorm room next door
- Health risk from second-hand smoke.

**Effect of negative externalities**
- If a good generates a negative externality, quantity consumed > socially desirable
- Intuition: Consumers and firms pay only part of the ost of their actions
- Full cost = private cost + externality

**Example: Electricity**
- Consider a power plant that burns coal -> Pollution
- Generating electricity has 2 costs
	- Private cost
		- Fixed cost: Coal. Variable cost: Hiring workers
	- External cost:
		- Health cost of pollution(not taken into account)
		- Asthma attacks, increased heart problems etc. of people who live around it
	- Problem: In a free market, polluters do not pay the external cost -> Not job of plant to take into account externalties
Social cost = private + external cost
Supply (private cost)

The external cost is the **dollar** value of the health costs caused by pollution (hard to quantify)

**Market equilibrium is Inefficient**
Market eq'm (Q=25) greater than social optimum (Q=20)
*Social cost = private cost + externality*

- *Pollution as Negative Externality*
	Overproduction of the good that has negative externality

**Internalizing the Externality: Solution 1**
Corrective tax: Tax designed to induce people to take account of the negative externality they cause.
- A tax on polluiton that is = externality
- It reduces pollution by the "right" amount
- It internalizes the externality

New supply curve = S + tax
Tax = external cost of pollution S

**Climate Change and the Carbon Tax**
- CO2 is the main externlaity
- Social cost incldues all cost of climate change
	- Ecological costs
	- Economic costs
- Best solution: a carbon tax
	- Each good is taxed based on its carbon content
	- *Much more costly to do this*
- It reduces production of goods that generate CO2
	- It does not affect goods that do not generate CO2
- Challenge: global problem
	- Free rider problem
If only adopted by one country or one state, then it is disadvantageous to that one country/state. However, if done by everyone in the world, then no problem.

*Substantially reduce the consumption and production of the goods in-line with the amount of detrimental welfare lost*
- Disincentivise the consumption of gigantic gasoline cars (in-theory) in favour of electric cars.

Low income households -> steeper necessity cost. 
Carbon tax schemes -> Use to subsidise low income lump-sum for poor families. 

Instead of taxing:
- Subsidies on methods of good production that is not using carbon. 

**Solution #2: Cap and Trade/Quotas**
- **Cap and Trade**: Quantity regulation implemented by allocating a fixed number of permits, which can then be traded
	- Like a corrective tax
- **Quota**: Limit on maximum quantity of a good that can be sold.
	- Not letting people / firms make more of a good
	- Corrective tax
