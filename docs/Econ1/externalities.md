*Externalities* are important because they lead to market failure, producing inefficient outcomes that aren’t in society’s best interest. 

This failure arises when there are bystanders who are affected by your choices and who can’t easily shape them. As a result, their interests are ignored or underweighted. The key insight of this chapter is that when people make decisions without facing the full consequences of their actions—that is, when externalities are involved—bad outcomes can result.

Examples of such extrenalities:
- If I stand up at a concert, you won’t be able to see the stage.
- If I smoke near you, my secondhand smoke might cause you to get cancer.
- If I take antibiotics too often, a resistant bacterial strain is more likely to form that makes antibiotics less effective for you.
- If I choose to drive a big SUV instead of a smaller hatchback, then you’re more likely to sustain a life-threatening injury if our cars collide.
- If I’m disruptive during your economics class, you’ll probably learn less.
- If I’m trolling on social media sites, you’ll find them less pleasant and less useful.

Negative externalities create problems because people often make decisions without taking full account of the costs that their choices impose on others. But if they were forced to pay for the costs they impose on others, they might do something less annoying instead. When people fail to account for the costs their negative externalities impose, they do more of these activities than would be in society’s best interest.

- When you plant a tree, it’ll recycle carbon dioxide into oxygen, which improves air quality for everyone in your neighborhood.
- When you buy a big-screen television for your living room, your roommates will also enjoy being able to watch movies.
- When you work hard and earn a pay rise, you’ll pay more taxes, which fund better schools, parks, and other government services that benefit your community.
- When you discover a brilliant new scientific breakthrough, other entrepreneurs might use your idea to launch their own new products.
- When you prepare before your study group meeting, your friends will benefit from your insights.
- When you exercise regularly, you’ll become healthier and your health insurer will benefit because they’ll likely spend less on your medical care.

Positive externalities sound like a good thing, since in each of these cases, your actions help other people. But they still lead to market failure because people typically make decisions without taking full account of the positive effects of their choices on bystanders. As a result, they’ll do less of these socially useful activities than is in society’s best interest. That means that even better outcomes could occur if the benefits to society were taken into account.

A price change isn’t an externality because once you total up the effects, it generates neither costs nor benefits. Price changes aren’t an externality, but rather a redistribution between buyers and sellers

 The forces of supply and demand often yield the best possible outcomes for **buyers and sellers**.
 
The Rational Rule for Society: Produce more of an item as long as its marginal social benefit is at least as large as the marginal social cost.

When businesses don’t take account of the costs of the pollution they emit, they do more of it. This isn’t just about gasoline: The same logic shows that any product involving negative externalities will be overproduced. This intuition also hints at a policy solution: Try to find ways to make polluters bear all the costs of their actions—including the cost of pollution. These higher costs can counter the incentives that lead to the overproduction of products with negative externalities.

If society could eliminate pollution at no cost, then their reasoning is right. But the reality is that cutting pollution is costly. It’s costly because we can only cut pollution by also cutting those activities that cause pollution. Fossil fuels present a trade-off: They cause harmful pollution, but they also make life more convenient. The whole point of our analysis has been to find the right balance by taking into account all the costs and all the benefits of using fossil fuels.

**NEGATIVE EXTERNALITY AT WORK**
Some economists invited people to lunch to find out how much people ignore the costs they impose on others. Some folks were told they would pay only for what they personally ordered, and they spent about $9 each, on average. But those folks who were told that the whole table would split the bill ended up spending about $13 each. And when the researchers said they would pay for everyone’s lunch—which is the experimental equivalent of your boss paying for a corporate lunch—the average bill rose to $22 per person

**POSITIVE EXTERNALITY AT WORK**
Positive externalities might just explain why you don’t work out, eat healthy, study, or save enough. How? Psychologists view your mind as being engaged in an internal struggle between your current self and your future self. You can think of your current self as making decisions, and your future self as being like a “bystander” who is affected by the choices your present self makes.

Let’s see how this shapes your decision about whether or not to go to the gym. Your current self considers the cost of working out, which includes the effort required to go to the gym and exercise. But the benefits of working out mainly accrue to your future self, who’ll enjoy better health. This means that your current self sees little benefit to working out. The problem is that your current self considers benefits that accrue to your future self to be an externality, and so your current self doesn’t take them into account. Because your current self makes all the decisions, you’ll exercise less often than is optimal for the “society” of both your current and future self. This same logic applies to any activity where your current self bears the cost and your future self enjoys the benefit. That’s why the same ideas might explain why you don’t eat healthy food often enough, why you study too little, and why you don’t save enough.

These are both examples of an insight called the Coase Theorem, which says that when people can bargain costlessly and legal rights are clear and enforced—so that it’s possible to enforce these agreements—then externality problems can be solved by private bargaining. For example, loud music benefits your head-banging neighbors, but when they’re choosing the volume, they typically don’t take account of the cost to your sleep. By paying your neighbor for quiet, you effectively raise the opportunity cost to them of playing loud music because that would mean forgoing your $5 side payment. You’ve given your neighbor an incentive to consider the broader costs of their actions.

Consider the externality problem facing executives at Google, which makes most of its money from online advertising. From Google’s perspective, the more people who have access to the internet, the better, because then it’ll sell more ads, increasing its profits. But to the cable companies that provide internet service, this extra profit is a positive externality—they see Google as a bystander, and the extra profits Google earns are an external benefit of providing internet access. The result is that internet access is underprovided, relative to what would occur if Google’s extra profits were taken into account. Can you think of a way for cable companies to internalize this externality?

Google did, and here’s its answer: It is building high-speed wireless internet networks in sub-Saharan Africa and Southeast Asia to reach people outside of major cities. This investment internalizes the externality that Google enjoys from more people being online, because it’ll earn both the revenue that an internet provider would earn, as well as extra advertising revenue from having more people online.

**Mergers can solve externality problems.**
There’s an alternative type of private bargain that Google could have considered: a merger. If it merged with an internet service provider, then the new combined entity would make decisions about where to build wireless networks, taking account of both the direct revenues from providing internet service, and also the extra advertising revenue that Google will earn.

In fact, this is a key reason that companies are often involved in several lines of business. When there are externalities across different markets, it’s profitable for a business to operate in each market, so that the folks at headquarters can make decisions that internalize all the externalities involved.

Private bargaining won’t always work, particularly when it’s difficult or costly to reach a bargain. For instance, consider the global warming problem. The total benefits to slowing global warming exceed the costs, and so in theory, there’s a way in which those who would gain from lower greenhouse gas levels could strike a bargain where they pay polluters to pollute less. The problem is that in practice, there’s no way for billions of people spread all around the world to negotiate with millions of polluters headquartered in different countries. It may even be infeasible, because many of those who would benefit from addressing global warming are yet to be born, and so they can’t bargain to protect their future Earth. That’s why private bargaining isn’t going to solve the global warming problem.

Indeed, many of our most important pressing environmental problems affect many people, and so the cost of bargaining is high. Moreover, while many environmental problems are important to society as a whole, the benefit to each individual from solving them is small. (How much would you, personally, be willing to pay to save the spotted owl from extinction?) In these cases, there’s no hope that bargaining will solve externality problems. And when private bargaining can’t solve externality problems, it’s time to look for other solutions. That’s what we’ll explore next.

To see how a corrective tax works, put yourself in the shoes of an oil refinery executive trying to decide how much gas to produce. You’ll focus on your company’s marginal private costs, because that’s what affects your bottom line, and you’ll largely ignore the marginal external cost of the increased pollution (which is $2.10 per gallon) because it doesn’t affect your profits. But a tax equal to the $2.10-per-gallon marginal external cost will lead you to respond as if you were taking account of the marginal external costs. Thus, the tax effectively internalizes the externality by making the costs of the negative externality internal to the supplier’s cost-benefit calculations.

When people cannot be easily excluded from using something, a particular kind of externality problem called the free-rider problem can occur, in which someone can enjoy the benefits of something without bearing the costs. For instance, if you enjoy beautiful architecture, breathing clean air, or living free from the risk of smallpox, you are likely free-riding on the work of others. Beautiful architecture, clean air, and the eradication of disease are all nonexcludable—you can’t prevent people who don’t pay from enjoying their benefits. Free riders don’t pay for the benefits they receive, and are therefore bystanders, enjoying positive externalities. As with other types of positive externalities, the market ignores the interests of bystanders, and as a result may underproduce the good, or even worse, fail to provide it at all.

Whenever there are bystanders who benefit from your actions without contributing (that is, when something is nonexcludable), and when their benefits don’t subtract from anyone else’s (that is, when consumption is nonrival), then a positive externality results. As we saw earlier, activities involving positive externalities are underproduced, because buyers and sellers don’t take account of the benefits to free riders.

Other public goods are funded in more creative ways. For instance, while many radio stations rely on advertising, National Public Radio—which is a public good—is funded largely by social pressure to make voluntary donations. Likewise, many schools get parents to voluntarily provide public goods, such as cleaning up the school grounds or helping in the classroom, by relying on the social norms of parental involvement.

Businesses try to turn public goods into club goods.
A public good is nonexcludable and nonrival, but businesses have an incentive to try to find a way to make them excludable. For example, you could buy some land, build a road on it, set up a tollbooth, and only let people pass if they pay you. The road is now excludable, but still largely nonrival. Sure, there’s wear and tear on the road, and too many people could cause congestion. But when there isn’t much traffic, the marginal cost of a car is close to zero.

Economists call these kinds of goods—ones that are excludable but nonrival in consumption—club goods. They are a type of local monopoly, and just like all monopolies left to their own devices, they charge a higher price, leading the quantity that they sell to be lower than the socially optimal quantity. What this means is that businesses often provide club goods, but they underprovide them.


Here’s how club goods are relevant: Businesses try to solve the problem of public goods by figuring out how to exclude people. If they can figure out how to exclude people, they can turn a public good into a club good. For example, cable television figured out how to turn the public good of broadcast television into a club good by scrambling their signal so only paying customers can get it. However, cable television is a nonrival good, and this means that the marginal cost of an additional viewer is zero. As a result, there are lots of people for whom the price of cable TV is set higher than their marginal benefit, even though the marginal cost of providing them with cable TV is below their marginal benefit.

So while businesses can attempt to solve public goods by creating ways to exclude nonpaying customers, they don’t fully solve the problems inherent in public goods since they underprovide club goods.
