**Human Capital**
Employers look for **human capital** when trying to determine which workers are more roductive
- **Human Capital**
	- education
	- on-the-job training
	- work experience
- Human capial affects productivity $\rightarrow$ labor demand and therefore wages
**==On top of making you more productive==**
- In addition: Education is  signal that helps employers identify better workers(IQ, focus, work ethic)
- By going to college, it signals that they have more desirable characteristics
*Signalling* does matter, but the larger reason for why college grads earn more is because of what is being learned during college.

**The increasing Value of College**
the gap between college-educated and non-college-educated workers is growing

Percentage difference for college graduates vs high school diploma.

US is trading with other countries. 
Demand for higher skilled jobs is greater, but demand for lower-skilled jobs goes down, due to international trade.
- The U.S is trading its high-skilled labor as its comparative advnatage 

Online degree earn / command lower wages than in-person degrees. Two potential reasons
1) Online degrees may be less of an add value than in-person degrees
2) online degrees have less signalling value to employers

**Why is education becoming more valuable?**
1. *International Trade*
	1. Rising exports of goods made with skilled labor(Demand) $\rightarrow$ globalized competition 
	2. Rising imports of goods made with unskiled labor(Supply) $\rightarrow$ globalized competition 
2. *New Technologies*
	1. Increased demand for skilled workers, reduced demand for unskilled workers. (Demand)
	2. More engineers and robots that replace the work of the low-skilled workers
3. *Immigration* of low skilled workers

The demand is decreasing much faster, for the market for low skilled labor.

**Efficiency Wages**
Sometimes employers pay workers more to *make* them more productive
- A higher wage provides an incentive to keep working hard
- Some jobs pay more because effort is costlier to monitor
For example, paying Nanny more money than what is determined by the equilibrium, to incentivise them to do well in their job(taking care of the kid)

**Labor Supply Factors That Explain Why Wages Vary**
- Now we turn to factors that have to do with worker labor supply
- Labor supply vaies across different types of jobs
- Jobs that are easier, more flexible, less risky, more pleasant have higher supply of workers
- Jobs that are less pleasant, more risky, less pleasant have a lower supply of workers
Cosmetologist or Mortician:
Obviously, one is more pleasant than the other.
**Compensating differentials**
	- The difference in wages required to offset the desirable or undesirable aspects of a job.
	- Compensating differentials encourage people to take unpleasant jobs
**Compensating Differentials**
- The more *risky, unpleasant* or *stressful* a job is, the higher  the equilibrium wage. Otherwise, people would not accept to do those jobs.
- Labor supply for these jobs are "scarce"
- Examples:
	- Coal miners and fire fighters are paid more to compensate them for the extra risks
	- Night shift workers are paid more
	- Artists are paid less

1. Yes cuz Iron workers are taking higher risks
2. Yes cuz data entry technician jobs are unpleasant
3. No
4. Yes cuz skills are the same but wage differential is due to the desirability

**Institutional Factors that explain shifting of supply and demand**
**Govt regulations**
Occupational licensing:
- Occupational licenses set education and training required for a job
- By decreasing the labor supply, licensing requirements raise the wages of those who do get licenses
