**Opportunity cost of good $A$** 
= hours to produce 1 unit of A
/ hours to produce 1 unit of alternative

= (# of good sacrificed of Alternative to produce one unit)

**WHAT I SHOULD REVIEW**
- Calculating opportunity cost, definitions
- Tarrifs and drawing diagrams for international... tarriffs and subsidies and others. 

**Domestic Dynamics**
- Higher domestic producer surplus
- Lower domestic consumer surplus
**International Producers**
-> Stays roughly constant, as world price (in theory) doesn't change based on one country's tarriff. 

**Carbon Pricing** is not on the midterm (not in scope)
