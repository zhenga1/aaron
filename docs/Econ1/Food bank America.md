A field of economics—often associated with the Nobel Prize  winning contributions of Al Roth—has been aimed at designing mechanisms so  
that outcomes in  nonmarket settings can better reflect what consumers want.

Specifically, the author was part of a group that designed a mechanism through which Feeding America transitioned from a **centralized allocation system**, in which food banks (implicitly) queued for food, **to a system in which they bid daily in auctions** for truckloads of food using a “fake” currency that the nonprofit designed.

**Ways of allocating goods without an actual price/way to discriminate**
The first is to **ask consumers to rank a set of possible  outcomes**. For example, a student lists which school she likes best, second best, and  
so on on—or a budding medical resident ranks hospitals. Through appropriate  choice of mechanism, the consumer finds it in her interest to report truthfully, and is then efficiently “matched” to an outcome. The second way is to use a **more  
standard market setting** where goods have prices, but *where participants can only use a specialized currency to buy the goods in the allocation system.*

**Initial Method:**
Need is calculated via a customised metric, whereby food was given out to the banks based on a sort of "wait your turn" method.

The food bank had 4–6 hours to say “yes” or “no.” After a food bank was offered food, its position in the queue would be recalculated, as its measure of food received relative to need would change. If it turned down the offer, the load would go to the next food bank in the queue. This mechanism had been used since the late 1980s, and it allocated 200–220 million pounds of food each year  
from 2000 to 2004. Feeding America did not distinguish much between different kinds of food, so that each food bank on average got a similar product mix from them (though randomly a food bank could get lucky or unlucky in whether it would  
get food that was popular among participants).

Problems:
1) Unaware of the needs of each food bank. Equal delivery of all food products to each food bank(which might have excess of certain product and shortage in otherse).
2) Food frequently spoils before deadline cuz foodbanks take too long to respond with the queuing system

Solution:(bidding via fake currency(handed out to each foodbank based on percceived need))
- sealed bid(preventing snipe)
- fractional bidding(smaller food banks can combine their bids (each contributing a fraction), and later arrange for splitting of the food items delivered)
- Contracting out bidding to more experienced members
	- A concern was that some food banks—again most likely the smaller ones—would find bidding so intimidating that they would largely withdraw from the allocation process. This concern was alleviated by Feeding America giving the option to delegate bidding to an employee of Feeding America, where a food bank could simply outline in broad terms its needs to that person.

- Credit system(for smaller food banks with less need)
	- They pay off those debts with at least half their future allocations of shares—meaning the nightly redistribution of shares used on that day (described below)—until debt is paid off
- Negative pricing
	- So basically if a food item is incredibly undesirable, food banks can put nnegative pricing on the food item, so essentially if they are later forced to keep the food due to various reasons, the aformentioned food bank will get more (of the fake currency) that they can then use on more products. 
	- Feeding America also has pressure to give out food items it receives, cuz otherwise the donor will be pissed
- Overriding allocation rule, giving some food banks more or less fake currency depending on extenuating circumstances
	- As one extreme example, Hurricane Katrina hit  New Orleans soon after the redesign committee’s deliberations. A less-extreme example might be the closure of a major local manufacturing plant


**GOAL FACTOR:**
Number of poor in a food bank’s area compared to the national average.

In the older queuing approach, Feeding America treated all pounds of food as equal. With the bidding system, some food banks have chosen to buy mainly large quantities of cheap food, while others buy smaller quantities of more expensive food. Moreover, some food-rich banks never spend all their shares, which benefits the food poor.

Here we have the reallocation of demand for food rich and food poor.

Rich wants more good quality food whilst poor wants more lower quality food.
-However, Rich is not inclined to spend all of their allocated currency, so they acctually consume less than their allocation 


Auctions have revealed willingness to pay for different kinds of food (who would have guessed that one pound of cereal was worth almost 50 pounds of produce?), which has allowed food banks to sort more efficiently on the quality–
quantity dimension. In this way, the market system has allowed gains not possible with centralized assignment.

No food bank has ever chosen to delegate
bidding control to Feeding America except for cases where the director is on vacation for a short period. Even more striking is that food banks have never submitted a request for a special hearing by the Fairness and Equity Committee, and so thatcommittee has never convened.
