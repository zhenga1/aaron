**The Labor Market**
==Our goal: ==Understand how wages and employment are determined by labor supply and demand
- Wages are the price of labor
- Hours of work, or employment, are the quantity of labour

==Goal next lecture:== Understand why some workers earn high wages and while others earn low wages.

==Next series of lectures:== Will study the  macroeconomic framework, what govenrments can do to fix these problems

**Labor Demand**
It slopes downwards
- If the wage is high => Employer labor costs are high -> They sell fewer goods => They hire fewer employees
- If the wage is low => employer labor are low => They sell more goods => they hire mmore employees
- It is the law of demand, applied to the labor market

**How many workers should a firm hire?**
- Compare the marginal cost and benefit of another worker:
- ==BENEFIT:== The **marginal revenue product** measures the marginal revenue from hiring an extra worker
	- The **marginal product of labor** (the extra production that occurs from hiring an extra worker) $\times$ (price of product)
- ==COST== The wage is the marginal cost of the employee (effectively what the firm must sacrifice to hire that one employee)

**Rational Rules for Employers**: 
Hire more workers if the marginal revenue product is greater than (or equal to) the wage. 
- Keep hiring until Marginal benefit = Marginal cost
- This rule maximizes profits

**Example: Hair Salon**

==Rule:== Keep hiring until wage equals *marginal revenue product*
Marginal Revenue Product = (Marginal) Wage per employer
So basically the first hair stylist probably brings in a lot of revenue, the second hair stylist brings in less revenue, and the next few hair stylists don't bring in that many revenue. 
The profit maximization point occurs when the marginal (hair stylist revenue) is equal to the marginal cost(wage) of that hair stylist

**Labor Demand**
- Since the wage equals the marginal product of labor, the labor demand is equal to the marginal product of labor
- Labor demand is downward-sloping because the marginal (revenue) each subsequent worker brings is decreasing.

**What shifts Labor Demand?**
1. Shift in demand for your product
	1. Derived demand: the demand for labor is derived from the demand for the stuff labor makes.
	2. For example, hair stylist demand decreased by a lot during the covid-19 times
2. Shift in productivity of wokrers (caused by better technology or better management)
3. Changes in taxes and regulations

**Q**: Suppose price of haircuts rises. What happenes to demand for hair stylists?
**A**: Demand increases

What increases is the **demand** of the product.

**Market labor Supply**
It slopes upward
- If the wage is low, employees prefer to take other jobs or not work
- If the wage is high, employees flock to the high-wage job
- It is the law of supply appied to the labor market
![[EpicPen_ldMKC0LF9X.png]]

Three reasons for **upward sloping market labor supply**:
1. New people may be induced to enter the workforce as wages rise
	1. Such as people who are not originally working
2. Existing workers may put in more hours as the wage rises
3. Some people may switch occupations to thsose with higher wages.

**Market Labor Supply Curve**
Factors that *shift* the market labor supply curve:
1. Changing wages in other occupations
2. Changing numbers of potential workers
	1. Size of labor pool(all workers that can work in that job, for example)
3. Changing benefits of not working
4. Nonwage benefits, and income taxes

==**Marginal Product of Labor** vs **Marginal Revenue Product**==
- **Marginal Product of Labor** - Amount of output the extra worker brings to the table(no of # produced, etc)
- **Marginal Revenue Product** - Amount of output of the extra worker multiplied by the value of (that extra unit of output), which is usually just the price of one unit of that output.

Fewer potential workers
$\rightarrow$ A decrease in labor supply
**Result:** higher wages, fewer jobs

The price of statistical sofware and powerful computers falls. *What happenes to labor market for data analysts?*
Cheaper price for complementary capital $\rightarrow$ An increase in labor demand
**Result:** Higher wages, more jobs
