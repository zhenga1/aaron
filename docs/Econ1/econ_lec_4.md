GAINS FROM TRADE
What do markets do ?
- Markets allocate stuff
- Markets creates gains from trade by effecively allocating tasks
	- Gains from tradde; The benefits that come from reallocating resources,
	goods, and services to better uses

Opportunity costs:
- The opportunity cost of doing a task is the output capable of being 
produced in an alternative task
- It can be calculated as follows:


Question

Suppose that it takes you two hours to complete your economics homework
and four hours to complete your philosophy homework. What is 
opportunity cost?

A. Half of philosophy homework

COMPARATIVE ADVANTAGEE:
You have comparative advantage in a task if you can complete it at lower
opportunity cost than someone else
- Don't make everything yourself.
- Specialize in those activities that you have a comparative advantage
- Rely on trading partners for rest

Helena-> Can vaccum house in 4 hours or make meal in 2 hous.
Jamie -> Can vacuum house in 4 hours or make meal in 1 hour.

Comparative advantage ---> ALL about opportunity cost
Opportunity cost principle -> True cost of something is what one must 
give up to get it. 

True cost of Helen or Jamie's vaccumming -> Need to ask "Or what?"

To get the most output with your given inputs, you should allocate 
each task to the person with the lowest opportunity cost(when there 
are two exact tasks)

And it shows that Helen will make the biggest contribution if 
she’s assigned to the task that she’s least bad at relative to Jamie.

That’s such an important point that I’m going to say it again: 
You should allocate each task to the person who can do it at the 
lowest opportunity cost.

This idea is called comparative advantage

Comparative -> Opportunity cost compares what can be produced if assigned 
one task with what you would produce if spent time on another task.

Advantage -> Lower opportunity cost means give up less to get task done

How should they allocate two tasks?


Gain from trade due to comparative advantage
- Consider 9 hour work day
- Output under specialization:
	- Lakisha; 3 wills
	- Zara: 1 employment contract
- Output if they both do both tasks:
	- Lakisha: 1 will + 1 employment contract	
	- Zara: 1 employment contract
=> Total output is larger under specialization

It’s often most intuitive to think of comparative advantage in 
exactly these terms: You have a comparative advantage in the 
task that you’re least bad at. Everyone has a comparative advantage
in something, even if they don’t have an absolute advantage in 
anything, because everyone must be least bad at something as 
long as people have different opportunity costs.

Question: What if there are certain quotas, requirements to the two different goods required? What if the different tasks are valued differently?

--> Focus on next class(prof's answer)

Opportunity cost = hours (cost) required for production of good

Comparative Advanage Drives international trade
- The gains from trade created by comparative advantage between coutnries

Why do we trade with individual sand other countries?
- US produces goods & services for which it has comparative advantage
- Trades for everything else
- By specialising, total output produced is larger
	- Increases opportunities for everyone involved
- Same intuition as the law office example, basically comparative advantage is very helpful
