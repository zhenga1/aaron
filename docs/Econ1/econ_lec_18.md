**But the AD-AS framework summarizes a different set of macroeconomic forces.**

These different curves **summarize different trade-offs**. In a **microeconomic context**, the key opportunity cost of buying gasoline is not buying something else. But in a **macroeconomic context** we’re focused on spending on all goods and services, and so the relevant opportunity cost of buying output today is that you can’t save your money so that you can buy more output in the future. In micro, the key trade-offs are across products, while in macro the key trade-offs are across time.

Aggregate expenditure is the sum of four components:

==Consumption: ==When households buy goods and services
+ **Planned investment:** When businesses purchase new capital
+ **Government purchases:** When the government buys goods and services
+ **Net exports:** Spending by foreigners on American-made exports, less spending by Americans on foreign-made imports.

Economists often use abbreviations to simplify things, and so you might find it easier to write it this way:

The thing is, if you can quiet your fear of not sleeping, you’ll find it easier to fall asleep. If you believe you can fall asleep, you probably will. It’s a self-fulfilling prophecy. The same kind of self-fulfilling prophecy that prevents you from getting to sleep can cause an economic boom or bust. If you fear that a recession’s looming, you might spend less. The problem is that if lots of people fear that a recession is looming, then lots of people will spend less, and aggregate demand will decrease. So if people fear a recession, there will probably be a recession. Pessimistic beliefs about the economy can create a pessimistic reality. President Franklin D. Roosevelt summarized this logic toward the end of the Great Depression, famously telling Americans that “the only thing we have to fear is fear itself.”

A strong economy with high GDP is good news for Outback Steakhouse because when incomes are high, your customers are more willing to splurge on a steak dinner. When the economy is doing particularly well, you’ll find your restaurants overflowing with customers, and you’ll need to pay your staff overtime to keep up. Even then, you might not be able to keep up, and some of your customers might leave rather than wait two hours for a table.

A strong economy can lead to excess demand given your limited seating capacity. In the long run, if business continues to boom, it’s worth building more restaurants. But that takes years; in the short run, you’re stuck with your existing seating capacity, which means it’s time to raise your prices. After all, even with higher prices, you can still fill your restaurant. And those higher prices will help cover your overtime bill.

When GDP is low, millions of businesses face insufficient demand. Like Outback, most will find that their marginal costs are low when they’re producing well below their capacity. They’ll follow the same logic as Jeff Smith and respond to insufficient demand with lower prices. The result is that in periods of low GDP, the average price level across the whole economy will tend to be a bit lower than it would otherwise be.

Lower production costs lead businesses to charge lower prices. As a result, lower production costs reduce the average price level across the whole economy (at any given level of output), thereby shifting the aggregate supply curve downward or to the right. Because this shift leads to an increase in the quantity of output associated with any given price, we say that lower production costs lead to an increase in aggregate supply. This increase arises because lower production costs boost the profitability of producing stuff, leading suppliers to increase the quantity of output they’ll produce at any given price level. Panel A on the left of Figure 6 shows that an increase in aggregate supply—by shifting the aggregate supply curve to the right—leads to both higher GDP and a lower price level. That is, it causes an economic expansion accompanied by deflation. (In reality there are often other factors driving inflation, and so this might lead to a decrease in inflation rather than outright deflation.)

**An inflation-induced response:** Through 2008, widespread price restraint led the price level to be lower than it otherwise would be, and inflation fell sharply. When the Fed is worried that inflation is too low, it responds by cutting the real interest rate. We call this an inflation-induced response.
- This form of increase in the interest rate will not affect the Aggregate demand curve at all, as the **real interest rate** changes exactly as expected

**An output-induced response:** But the Fed cut interest rates much more dramatically than needed to offset the decline in inflation. It did so because it has another objective: promoting maximal employment and hence output. Thus, the Fed cut the real interest rate even further in an effort to combat the decline in GDP. We call this an output-induced response.
- This actually shifts the output by shifting the Aggregate Demand curve

**Inflation will be lower when you forecast that the price level will be lower than it otherwise would be.**


These different responses over different time horizons arise because in the very short run prices don’t adjust at all, leaving the **burden of adjustment to quantities**, while in the long run prices fully adjust, leaving **none of the burden of adjustment to quantities**. Let’s now explore what happens in between—over the months or years that are relevant to analyzing the ups and downs of the business cycle.
