We have the formula:
Price elasticity of demand

$= \frac{\Delta Q}{\Delta P}$. We also have:
$\Delta Q = \frac{Q_2-Q_1}{(Q_2+Q_1)/2}$
If we are given the price elasticity of demand, the percentage changes in one of the elements will be dependent on the others.

As long as you are applying the midpoint formula and plugging that into the elasticity equation, everything should be fine. 

Example:
Toll rate       No of vehicles
$8                10,000
$6                12,000

Price elasticity of demand: $= ((10000-12000)/11000)/((8-6)/7)$
$=(2000/11000)/(2/7) = 7/11 =0.6363<1$

$R(8) = 80,000$
$R(6) = 72,000$

Labour market is special because the typical suppliers are the consumers/demanders in this market.
