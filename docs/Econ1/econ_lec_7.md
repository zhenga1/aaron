**The economics of energy efficiency**
**KEY CONCEPTS:**
**Energy efficiency:** a measure of the quantity of energy used to produce a unit of energy service(lighting, heating, cooling, etc)
**Energy conservation:** A reduction in the total amount of energy consumed (this may or may not be associated with an increase in energy efficiency)
**Maximizing energy efficiency will generally not imply maximizing economic efficiency**

# Energy Efficnecy basics
- Energy efficiency one of the many product characteristics that consumers value
- Privately optimal decision involves choosing level of energy efficiency that minimizes the net present value of private costs (holding oher attributes constant).
- Economic efficiency at a societal level entails minimzing the net present value of social costs. 

**Appliance Shopping(ECON 1 style)**
*What does  rational noeclassical consumer need to know to make the right decision*
Lets say you want to save 100 per year.
But to do this, you have to pay 100 right now.

Consumers are looking at **expenses** today, but neglecting the **potential benefits** tomorrow. 

Because of this externaltiy, we see that private consumers will definitely *underinvest* in the production of energy efficient systems

**Social versus private cost benefit calculation**
**The energy efficiency "gap"**
- Decision makers apper to "under-invest" in (privately) cost effective energy-efficint tecchnologies, relative to the predictions of some engineering and economic models.
- This energy efficiency investment gap looks even larger from a social perspective.
- What market failures/barriers might explain this gap?
	- Market failures from the idea of lack of information
**A large literaure in economics has explored this gap (and policies designed to close it) in industrialised countries**
- Incomplete information
- ...

**Energy demand growth is projected to occur primarily in developing countries**
(Team) investigates barriers to adoption of efficient fans by low-income indian households and evaluate interventions that could mitigate/eliminate these barriers
1. Do energy-efficient BLDC fans work well/save energy in low-income settings characterized by frequent outages and voltage flunctuations
2. What are the most important barriers to energy efficient fan usage
BLDC fans use **67%-83%** less electricity than the standard fan

Households pay around 2 rupees per household for electricity, but the maintaining of households energy standards is at least 7 rupees. (indian gov subsidise) 
In theory BLDC fans are better as they save more energy in the long run, but then not for the typical Indian household.
Indian govenrment hemorrhaging money by subsidising electricity. They don't rlly want to subsidise the fan as well.

**Review of key findings**
1. EE fans perform well in settings characterized by supply interruptions and voltage flunctuations
2. EE fans are highly cost-effecive from a social perspective
3. EE fans are not cost-effective for low-income households paying subsidized electricity prices
4. EE fan demand among low-income households is high a price points that could be rationalized on the basis of external benefits. 
- Lack of regulation 

**Policy implications**
- Absent policy intervention, India will see massive "lock in" of inefficient fans
- Demand will be low for efficient fans unless we can somehow decrease costs. 

Solutions:
- "subsidy swap" : direct benfeits transfer targeted at BPL households
- On-bill financing: Households can pay off a BLDC fan purchase via a higher electricity price.
- Fan trade-in/buy-back: Households who surrender an inefficient fan receive a rebate towards a BLDC fan.
