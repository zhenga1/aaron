Tourism tax... eventually they had to change the name to hospitality tax.
Even if you shift the tax burden completely to producers or consumers, both consumers and producers are all going to bear some burden, as the price paid by consumer and received by producer is dependent on both supply and demand.

This is still the price that consumers are receiving, but this is after the tax, the amount that people are receiving.

This has nothing to do with consumer cost, this just affects enjoyment of redbull. 



Relatively inelastic supply + demand curve

![[EpicPen_JnUl6AUkYB.png]]
Effectively a price increase for the buyers, a price deccrease for sellers,(in terms of what they receive)

Whoever has the most inelastic demand/supply is always goign to bear the bigger burden.
Or in other word:
Whichever demand/supplier has more inelastic demand/supply is going to bear the bigger burden. 

So inelastic demand/supply states that price changed doesn't influence quantity demanded /supplied much, so it indicates that the demand, supply is being needed by the demander/supplier.
