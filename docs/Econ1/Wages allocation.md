The **substitution effect** measures how people respond to a change in relative prices. When your wage goes up, the opportunity cost of an hour of leisure goes up. It’s as if leisure becomes more expensive, because you’ll have to give up more money to get an hour of leisure. 

This is called the substitution effect because higher wages are an incentive to substitute more work for less leisure. The substitution effect is why people work longer hours when their wages rise, and so it leads to an upward-sloping individual labor supply curve, as shown in Panel A of Figure 6.

The **income effect** measures how people’s choices change when they have more income. You learned in Chapter 2 that your demand for normal goods shifts to the right when your income rises. Because your demand curve is also your marginal benefit curve, this also means that your marginal benefit of normal goods goes up when your income increases. So what does this mean for leisure? For most people, leisure is a normal good, so a rise in income means an increase in the marginal benefit of leisure. Thus a higher wage—which boosts workers’ incomes—will lead them to choose more leisure, which means working fewer hours.

There’s another way of seeing this: A higher wage means that you have more income. What should you buy with your extra income? When your hourly wage rate rises, you don’t need to work as many hours to buy the things you were purchasing before. Rather than spending your pay increase buying more stuff, you might spend it buying more leisure time. The somewhat counterintuitive result is that the income effect provides a reason for workers to cut their hours in response to a wage rise. The income effect leads to a downward-sloping labor supply curve, as shown in Panel B of Figure 6.

The rise of new technologies is likely good news for economics students. Why? I’ll quote Google’s chief economist:

If you are looking for a career where your services will be in high demand, you should find something where you provide a scarce, complementary service to something that is getting ubiquitous and cheap. So what’s getting ubiquitous and cheap? Data. And what is complementary to data? Analysis.

What’s the leading framework for analyzing and interpreting data? Economics. Indeed, economics majors already earn more than most other majors. And as data becomes even more ubiquitous, your investment in understanding economics will become even more valuable. So keep reading, because studying economics is a great investment in your career.

If you were on the board of a major corporation, how much would you be willing to pay to get the very best talent to run the company? Before you answer, I’ll share with you the results of a recent study, which estimated that getting the very best chief executive will raise the value of your company by 0.016% more than the 250th best alternative. That doesn’t sound like much. But if your corporation is General Motors, which is worth roughly $50 billion, then even this very small difference is worth an extra $8 million. That’s a key reason big firms are willing to pay millions of dollars to get the very best managers.

There’s an important idea here: The more broadly you can spread your talent—say, across a big firm or a big market—the more likely it is that being slightly better than the competition will be enough to generate a multimillion-dollar pay deal. 

# Compensating Differentials
Have you ever thought of becoming a cosmetologist? If so, I’ve got a great deal for you. There’s a job that requires a similar amount of training, where you’re also paid to make people look good, while also earning a lot more money. And your customers will never be rude to you, nor will they squirm while you work on them. The job? Mortician. Interested? Probably not. I mean, imagine the awkward first dates you’ll experience as you describe what you do all day.

Because morticians and cosmetologists require similar training—both require a vocational degree—we can infer that the differences in their pay aren’t due to differences in their human capital. Instead, it’s because it is unpleasant to spend your days looking after corpses. After all, why would you—or anyone—accept such an unpleasant job unless you were paid a bit more? The extra wage boost that you would earn as a mortician is called a compensating differential—a difference in wages required to offset the undesirable (or desirable) aspects of the job. It’s compensating, because it compensates you for the attributes of the job. And it’s a differential, because it leads people with similar human capital to earn different wages.

**Compensating differentials depend on the preferences of other workers.**
Whether you’re offered a compensating differential or not depends on how the market as a whole—that is, other people—view a job attribute, not how you view it. That means that if you hate dogs, don’t expect to be paid a lot to work as a dog walker, because there are plenty of dog lovers who are thrilled to work with dogs, even if the pay is lousy.

This insight is the interdependence principle in action. It also provides useful advice: Think about your tastes compared to those of other workers. You’ll find a good match when you’ve found a job whose positive attributes are even more important to you than they are to others. Or look for a job whose negative attributes don’t bug you as much as they bug others, and you’ll enjoy the extra pay without being so worried about those negatives.

**How much is a life worth?**

How much money would I have to pay you to risk your life? You can’t say you’ll never risk it, because you already take a risk of dying every time you ride in a car. So, how much? It’s an important question, because it tells policy makers how much they should spend in trying to reduce these risks. And it’s closely related to compensating differentials.

One possible answer comes from analyzing how the occupational choices that people make reveal their own willingness to risk their lives. That is, you can compare the compensating differential that workers demand to enter risky industries like mining with that in less risky occupations. Recent research suggests that workers demand somewhere between $6,000 and $10,000 in extra income to compensate for a 0.1 percentage point increase in the probability of a fatal work injury. This means that, taken together, 1,000 workers accept an extra $6 to $10 million, in return for the likelihood that one of them will die. Stated this way, we can say that workers act as if they value one statistical life at $6 to $10 million!

**Monopsony power reduces wages.**
This means that the Hershey Trust has a lot of bargaining power. If it decides to offer low wages, your only options are to accept that low wage, get by without a job, or leave town. So even if your marginal revenue product is $1,000 per week, you might accept a job paying only $600 per week. This is an example of monopsony power—a business using its bargaining power as a major buyer to pay lower prices, including lower wages. (And if monopsony sounds like an odd word, it might help to realize that just as a monopoly is the only seller of a good, a monopsony is the only buyer.)

While Hershey is an extreme example, the same ideas apply in many other labor markets. The federal government is the dominant employer in Washington, DC. Universities are the main employers in towns like Ann Arbor, Ithaca, and Chapel Hill. A few tech behemoths such as Google, Facebook, and Apple play a major role in hiring tech talent in Silicon Valley. And monopsony power appears to be becoming more important in specific sectors of the economy. For instance, in the retail sector, mom-and-pop stores used to compete with each other for the best talent, and this competition would drive wages up. But today, many towns are dominated by one or two big-box stores like Walmart, and many of those big companies use their monopsony power to pay lower wages.

There’s a vibrant debate about how important monopsony power is in the broader labor market, and there are good arguments on both sides. Consider, for example, the market for teachers. By one view, the local school board is a lot like Hershey and has a lot of monopsony power, because it employs nearly all the teachers in the district. An alternative perspective suggests that teachers still have a lot of bargaining power because if they’re unhappy with their pay and conditions, they can threaten to move to other districts or change occupations.

Discrimination type one: Prejudice.
When most people think about discrimination, they usually conjure up visions of bigots whose hatred of some groups of people causes enormous harm to those people. This is the problem of prejudice, which refers to a preconceived bias against a group that’s not based on reason or experience. Prejudice remains a problem in some places and among some people, although in much of the United States the degree of prejudice—including the hatred of one group or explicit favoritism of others—appears to be declining.

**Prejudice**
A preconceived bias against a group that’s not based on reason or experience.
Economists sometimes call prejudice taste-based discrimination, because it’s not based on reason, but rather on people’s preference or taste for hiring one group over another. And prejudice is costly, not only to the victims of discrimination, but also to prejudiced employers. Why? A business is most profitable if it hires the most productive people at the lowest wage possible. If you’re prejudiced against a group of people, you’re limiting the pool of talent available to you. Selecting from a smaller talent pool means both that you’ve limited the supply of workers competing for a job—which leads to higher wages—and you’re less likely to find the most productive workers. It follows that it’s costly to be prejudiced.

Indeed, this points to a potentially profitable hiring strategy. If there are a lot of prejudiced employers in your labor market, then there are likely a lot of talented people who—because of their gender, race, ethnicity, religion, or sexuality—are still looking for a job that uses their full set of talents. It follows that a savvy employer can find especially good workers by hiring folks that other employers are prejudiced against.

Does this approach work? An owner of a Wall Street firm said that he hired a lot of women, reasoning that he could hire more talent at a lower price, because his competitors were prejudiced against women. If enough employers follow this strategy, they’ll offset some of the effects of prejudice. In this way, competitive market pressure can help reduce the role that prejudice plays in the labor market.

This logic also illustrates how prejudice can sometimes lead to segregation. For example, a century ago, most car makers would not hire black workers, but Ford saw an opportunity to hire talented workers who were overlooked by their rivals. The result was a segregated workforce, with mostly white workers at General Motors and mainly black workers at Ford.

**Discrimination type two: Implicit bias.**
Psychologists have recently developed a more subtle understanding of discrimination that recognizes that people often try very hard not to be biased. While you may strive to be impartial, when you need to make quick judgments, your brain simply doesn’t have time to make a complete analysis. And so without your conscious knowledge, your snap judgments may reflect implicit or unconscious associations. For instance, your brain may be more likely to associate masculine with aggression, or feminine with nurturing. It may even make associations between particular groups and honesty, tenacity, or leadership.

The result is a form of discrimination based on implicit bias, in which employers’ judgments are shaped by their unconscious attribution of particular qualities to members of specific groups. The problem is that these crude attributions can be harder to combat because you may not even be aware you’re making them. For instance, even though people may not mean to discriminate when they tip their taxi driver, the quick judgments they form may help explain why black taxi drivers receive smaller tips than white taxi drivers.

***implicit bias***
Judgments shaped by the unconscious attribution of particular qualities to specific groups.
As an employer, you want to hire the best person for the job, rather than allowing your unconscious attitudes to fool you into overlooking them. You can minimize the impact of your implicit biases by basing your hiring decisions on carefully structured assessments of individual candidates, rather than gut feelings.
