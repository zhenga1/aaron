**“The federal government is an insurance company with a military.”**
This old saying is an exaggeration, but it highlights the reality that the federal government spends most of its money on social insurance programs and the military. Social insurance refers to government-provided insurance against bad outcomes such as unemployment, illness, disability, or outliving your savings. Figure 2 shows that social insurance programs—which fall mostly in the slices for Social Security, unemployment, and labor, or Medicare and health—are some of the biggest slices of the federal spending pie. Taken together, these social insurance programs plus spending on the military and veterans’ benefits account for 80% of federal government spending. So that saying that the federal government is an insurance company with a military may not be exactly right, but it’s about 80% accurate.
