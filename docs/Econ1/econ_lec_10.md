**Social Insurance Prograams**
- Government-provided insurance against bd outcomes:
	- Job Loss -> Unemployment insurance
	- Health insurance
**Tax System**
- The tax system reduces inequality

**==Three Types of Taxation==**

**Proportional tax:**
- Taxpayers pay same fraction of income regardless of income
**Regressive tax**
- High-income taxpayers pay a smaller fraction of their income with taxation
**Progressive tax**
- Lower income taxpayers pay lower fraction of their income via tax

**Tax rate (federal):**

**Equity and Efficiency**
- The ideal tax system is
	- Efficient
	-One tax system is **more efficient** than another if it raises same amount of revenue at smaller cost to taxpayer
	- Equitable
	- Tax those with higher income to transfer money to those in need
- What is efficient is objective and does not depend on moral values 
- What is **fair** depends on our political and moral values:
	- Liberals want more redistribution
	- Conservatives want less redistribution
**In practice, there is a ==trade off== between equity and efficiency**

**The Costs of Redistribution: The leaky Bucket**
Redistribution is costly because of:
1. Higher taxes reduce incentive to work
2. Welfare reduces the incentive to work
=> Leaky Bucket

**The efficiency cost of income tax**
- Income tax is distortive because it discourages people from working
Example:
- Small business owner makes $60,000 before taxes
- If tax = 20%, he keeps $48,000 after taxes
- If tax = 33%, he keeps $40,000 after taxes

**Income Tax**

**Consumption Tax**
- Some economists advocate taxing consumption instead of income
	- Restore incentive to save
	- Better for long-run economic growth
	- Common in Europe
But, it is perceived as **unfair**. 
Equity-efficiency trade off. 
- Tax on consumption is fixed percentage, therefore it takes up higher percentage of income from the low income
- Also, lower income individuals spend a higher proportion of their money on consumption, since higher-income individuals often look to investments and more high value purchases, and their consumption takes up smaller percentage of income.

An example of a very inequitable tax is a **lump-sum tax**.
Example: Lump-sum tax = $4000/person

Income                    Average Tax Rate
20,000                             20%
40,000                             10%


**Lump-Sum Taxes**
A lump-sum tax is **the most efficient tax**
- *Causes no deadweight loss.* Does not distort incentives
But it is **unfair**:
- Relative to income, the poor pay more than the rich.
- Equity-efficiency trade off

**Assets** not equal to **income** 
**Assets** - Time, Land, Stocks, etc, not taxed
**Income** - Taxed unfortunately. Tax will only be levied when assets are liquidated. I.E liquid cash.
