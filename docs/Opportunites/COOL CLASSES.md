[CS 182. Designing, Visualizing and Understanding Deep Neural Networks](https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Courses/CS182)

**Catalog Description:** Deep Networks have revolutionized computer vision, language technology, robotics and control. They have growing impact in many other areas of science and engineering. They do not however, follow a closed or compact set of theoretical principles. In Yann Lecun's words they require "an interplay between intuitive insights, theoretical modeling, practical implementations, empirical studies, and scientific analyses." This course attempts to cover that ground.

-   [CS 285. Deep Reinforcement Learning, Decision Making, and Control](https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Courses/CS285)
    
    **Catalog Description:** Intersection of control, reinforcement learning, and deep learning. Deep learning methods, which train large parametric function approximators, achieve excellent results on problems that require reasoning about unstructured real-world situations (e.g., computer vision, speech recognition, NLP). Advanced treatment of the reinforcement learning formalism, the most critical model-free reinforcement learning algorithms (policy gradients, value function and Q-function learning, and actor-critic), a discussion of model-based reinforcement learning algorithms, an overview of imitation learning, and a range of advanced topics (e.g., exploration, model-based learning with video prediction, transfer learning, multi-task learning, and meta-learning).  
    **Units:** 3.0
