In the spherical coordinate system the counterpart of a rectangular box is a spherical

where a > 0 and $\beta-\alpha\leq2\pi$ , and $d-c\leq\pi$. Although we defined triple integrals by dividing solids into small boxes, it can be shown that dividing a solid into small spherical wedges always gives the same result.
