$\nabla f = \lambda \nabla g$
Which of the following is equivalent to $\nabla f = \lambda \nabla g$?

(a) $\nabla f$ is orthogonal to (tangent plane of) the constraint
(b) Level sets of $f$ and $g$ are tangent
(c) Direction of steepest increase in $f$ is directly perpendicular to constraint
(d) Constraint is a level set of F
(e) $D_u f$, for $\vec{u} \neq 0$ is a tangent vector to the constraint.
(f) $\nabla f$ is tangent to the constraint. 

(a), (b), (c), (e) are true, whilst (d), (f) are not.
