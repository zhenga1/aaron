If we rearrange the order of the terms in a infinite sum, then of course the value of the sum remains unchanged. But this is not always the case for an infinite series. By a rearrangement of an infinite series, we mean a series obtained by simply changing the order of the terms. For instance, a rearrangement of $a_n$ could start as follows:
$a_1, a_2, a_5, a_3, a_4$
It turns out that
if $a_n$ an is an absolutely convergent series with sum $S$, then any rearrangement of $a_n$ an has the same sum $S$
