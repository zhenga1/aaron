If at local max min there exists partial derivatives, then we must have:
$\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}=0, \frac{\partial f}{\partial y}=0$ 

One variable:
If $f(x)$ continuous under a certain closed interval $[a,b]$, then we must have $f(x)$ contains a absolute max and absolute min
Two variable:
Definition:
- A **closed set** $S$ in $R^2$ is all points containing its *boundary points*. -- 
- A **Boundary Point** of a closed set $S$ are all points $(a,b)$  in $R^2$ where we have any disk centered around $(a,b)$ must contain points in $S$ and points not in $S$.

If $f(x,y)$ continuous under certain closed set $D$, we must have $f(x,y)$ contains absolute max and min within that set.
