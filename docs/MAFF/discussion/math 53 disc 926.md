Q: Find absolute max and min of $f(x,y) = x+y-x\times y$ on the triangle with vertices $(0,0), (0,2),(4,0)$.
We can find that critical points:
	$f_{x} = 1-y=0, y=1$ 
	$f_{y} = 1-x = 0, x=1$
	$f_{xx} = 0, f_{yy} = 0, f_{xy}=-1$ 
So we see that the point $(1,1)$ is a saddle point. Hence, for the absoute minimum and maximum, we must check the boundary poitns
We have $f(0,y)=y$, so the min 
So we have
