$\int_C (2+x^2y)ds=\int_0^\pi (2+x^2y)dt = 2\pi + (-cos^3(t)/3) = 2\pi + 2/3$
$\int_C 2x ds = \int_{C_1} 2xds + \int_{C_2} 2xds=\int_0^1 2t sqrt(1+4t^2) dt$
$= \int_0^1 2tsqrt(1+4t^2)dt$

The line segment between two points $A$ and $B$ is parameterized by:
$\vec{r}(t) = (1-t)\vec{A} + t\vec{B}$ , or we also have $\vec{r}(t) = \vec{A}+t(\vec{B}-\vec{A})$ 
$0\leq t\leq 1$

All closed curves in gradient vector fields must have zero integral.
