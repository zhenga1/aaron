So therefore we have:
$f(r,\theta) (?) drd\theta$ where the ? is the stretching factor
So we see that:
$x=r\cos(\theta), y=r\sin(\theta)$
We see that when we shift the coordinate system from a system of $(x,y)$ to a system of $(r,\theta)$, we see that the area of the base changes. 

**Velocity Vector in XY**
For a coordinate vector in $(r,\theta)$, if $r$ were the x-axis, and $\theta$ was the y-axis, we see that going to the right in the $(r,\theta)$ plane corresponds to going directly away from the origin in the $(x,y)$ plane. Similarly, going directly upwards in the $(r,\theta)$ plane corresponds to going counterclockwise in the orthogonal direction towards the line away from the origin.

Therefore, we can see, intuitively, that the stretching factor when we transform from $(x,y)$ to $(r,\theta)$ coordinates is $r$ everytime.

Nobody cares about whether or not the area function is flipped.

If determinant is negative, you take the absolute value. Determinant is almost never zero except at special coordinate(points). Such as the polar transformation transforming $(x,y)$ to $(r,\theta)$. We see that when $(x,y)=(0,0)$, the determinant of the Jacobian matrix is 0, but thats like a special point.
