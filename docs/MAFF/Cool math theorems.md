Divergence of product of two functions $f, g$ 

$= div(f\cdot g) = f div(g) + g div(f)$
 Divergence of curl of function:
 $= div(curl f) = 0$

Curl of conservative vector field:
$= curl (F) = 0$

For incompressible fluid flow, we must have
$div(F) = 0$

The curl of a vector field isÂ **a vector field**. The curl of a vector field at point P measures the tendency of particles at P to rotate about the axis that points in the direction of the curl at P.

We see that these are the basic equations for the basic surfaces in the 3D plane.
- Hyperboloid
- Hyperbolic Paraboloid
- Hyperboloid of Two sheets
- Hyperboloid of one sheet
- Elliptic Paraboloid
- Ellipsoid
- cone
