- Major hurdles
- Sweep -> hiccups that did have, the coloring for the second sweep, couldn't fix the surface texture working
- Like ideas to do -> a plugin or tool or something to model something like a rubicks cube, something that can (a plugin) that works.

WHAT TO DO 
	- I gotta make a dude with two spherical feet and rectangular prism legs, with like cool mobius strips around the legs, I think that is pretty cool.
	- 
Torus knots 

Advancements:
- Several sweep paths that connect:
	- Then being able to merge sweep paths
	- That gives (you) freedom to design many other sweep paths
The air reporting?
- Identifier (suppressing the initial warning)?
Error message suppression

Monica: New sweep morph generator

Gosper curve:
- Enter and exit at fixed points.
- Visit all points(within grid) exccept for ccertain ones

Hilbert curve
- (1st generation) Just like a U shape
![[Zoom_Tb38BYroT2 1.png]]
Koch curve
JUST GOOGLE space filling curves and there are many examples.

Use the hilbert curve and try to extend it to 3d.
Use the sweep curve 

In addition to sweep path, we also define a few control paths.
- There will be many nodes, each node will have some basic cross-sections.
- Twist- How much additional rotation is being obtained. 
- Mark some of the nodes in the control path
- Give extra corrective action in the sweep.
- Using x direction, scale by factor of 1/2, using y direction, rotate by something (tangent) of something etc.etc. To make the entire thing more creative and fun.
- More dramatic changes to the cross-section
- Make a regular octagon, or we can make a 4 pointing stars. We sweep morph, making gradual transition from octagon to star shape. 
- Star shape -> gradually interpolate to the octagon
- Introduce -> new cross-sections, as long as those cross section have 8 vertices

sweep morph generator -
- > Sweep morph should be available, however I can't find the cpp file for some reason
