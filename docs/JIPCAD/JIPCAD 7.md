Would be good to add axes in nome  to make it easier to look at, just like solidworks. 


**Improvements to the extension thingy**
- Singled out "variable" expressions
- Able to run the debugger to run nome directly. 
- Debugger configuration
	- List out all generator names
	- Jump through lsit of all generators that we have to find exactly which one we want
- Different color of the hashtag
- Double click on any generator to find all similar generators
