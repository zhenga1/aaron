The programme is formed as the great evolution of the CAD progress from the 1980s. 
- From Berkeley SLIDE to JIPCAD
- Gradually over time, added new capabilities, sweep progress 
User might wanna see a cone:
- Maybe truncated at the top, 
	- 75% altitutde from the bottom. Maybe the cone has one parameter for the truncation level. If it is 0 then you only get one of the base polygon
- Whether the cone even wants a base plate or not.
- Oblique cone, offset, slope of cone, how much you are shifting the hypothetical top plate of the cone. 

- Add a functionality of loft -> from solidworks.
- Fusing sweeps together-> begin cap, endpath
- followup
- .nom, .jipcad, both extensions should be used

**Sweep morph:** Basically you can take a polygon to another polygon using the sweep-morph generator, which effectively can gradually sketch the shape by stretching/shrinking the polygonal shapes.
