Beautiful knots
- Edit page for the generators to make it more useful for others
Try to build a knot
- Pretty cool
10 - 20 points (polyline) for the knot
 Repeat the polyline points, make a bspline
 Then make a sweep using the points of the bspline
 JIPCAD use it to make sweep to sweep a knot.

Trefoil has 3 crossings
3 strands crossing with 3 other strands
9 crossings at each one of the points
29 crossings (for each knot)

Merge feature never works

4 dimensional symmetry -> You have 8 symmetries point. How to make a sharp corner

Having fewer control points, you should get very nice regular curve. Using cubic b-spline adding them, making it even smoother

What the rotate parameter does is it first describes a vector $<rx,ry,rz>$ (which is the rotation axis (the line that passes through $(0,0,0)$)). So this then you add the $(180)$, it will rotate around the particular axis by $180$

Sweep has a thing called *reverse*, which allows the path to go back onto itself.
