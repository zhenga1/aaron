To force a bspline to have a vertex at a certain point, we must have 3 collinear control points, such that the bspline will then be on the middle of the collinear points.

Kinks of the tangent

Instantialate, you have to define the mesh as the face. Create the mesh and then instance the mesh. 

Draw the polyline, instance it, and click text selection, and then make an instance of a face. 

**CSG modeling**
Constructive solid geometry (CSG) isÂ **a modelling paradigm that is used in many traditional CAD systems**. It essentially consists of using primitive solid objects and doing boolean operations with them, such as fusion, subtraction and intersection, in order to create a final shape.

Have a mesh, and remove the faces within the mesh via clicks. (that is a new functionality)

What really, how to make a generator that creates kline bottles or something.

Time is supposed to be in real time, in seconds
Frame is basically the variable that tells nome by what time interval to generate each frame image

Using time variable expression
Rotates through the rainbow colors even
RGB colors, rotating around

Trefoil knot

Mobius band is twisting, and that twisting will therefore create many knots(at least to 27)

There (DOES NOT EXIST) two crossing knot.

Icoso formations, Hilbert cuves.

Basically projecting a grid(whether be triangular or rectangular) onto a sphere. 

Essentially each line segment is predefined, and the thing is basically rotated and added together

Hilbert curve -> there are sometimes dissymmetries
