What is computer science?

The study of 
- What problems cnan be solved using computation,
how to solve those problems
What techniques lead to effetie solutions


Systems
Artificial Intelligence
	- Decision Making
	- Robotics
	- Natural Language Processing
		- Even more specific shit
		- Ansswering questions
		- Dialog
		-Translation
Graphics

Seccurity
Networking
Programming Languages
Theory
Scientific Computing

Common enemy -> complexity 
Common tool used to solve the enemy -> abstraction

The course is about:
Mastering abstraction
	Talking about something (without actually taking about the specifics).
Programming paradigms
	So that you can manage complexity

Language uses
- Python fundamentals
- Combinign multiple ideas in large projects
- How computers interpret programming languages

Other programming languages: Scheme & SQL
- A challenging course that will demand a lot of you

The videos that (the lecutres) are pretty good so some students choose not to come to live lecctures.


According to the Syllabus
There is no formal programming-related prerequisitee for CS61A but..
- Tking the course without any prior programming experience is typically very challenging
- Mmost CS 61A students have had significant prior programming experience.
- Studnets who take the course without prior programming experience 
typically must work substantially harder to master the material and
 tend to receive lower final grades in the course.

Students who take course later often get more out of it due to increased understanding.

Arou
CS10 -> course for beginners
C88C -> Computational structures in Data Science
-> based on CS61A , but covers only 3 out of 4 units worth of the content:
- Two programming projects (instead of four) that are adapted from CS 61A proejcts
- Everything you need to know to continue on to CS61B
- Omits the unit on how programs run other programs

Designed for students taking Data 8 but is now indepenedent
Course might be full, but expansion options are investigated. 

Course Policies
- Learning + Community

Collboration
Working together is highly encouraged
- Discuss everthign with each other; learn from your fellow studnets!
- Some projects can be completed with a partner
- Choose a partner from your discussion section

What constituttes academic misconduct/
- don't look at someone eelse's code
- Don't tell other people the answers. Can point out what is wrong and describe how to fix it or show relevant example.
- Copying project solutiosn causes people to fail this course
- We really do catch people who violate the rules, and we are getting beter at it

Build good habits now


SCORING:
- Around half is lab/discussion/homework 
- A third is Projects
- Tests/exams take up half of the course grade.
- Final exam takes quarter of course grade
- MT2 is more important than MT1

Exam advice:
Study early & often
Previous exams are a great way to test understanding & problem solving skills

Assignment advice:
Don't be afraid to ask for help!
Try using external resources (e.g., Google) to udnerstand errors
Try a personal project if you have time
