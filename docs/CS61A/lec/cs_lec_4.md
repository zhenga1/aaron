Prime Factorization

Each positive integer n has a set of prime factors: primes whose product is n

...
$8=2*2*2$
$9 = 3*3$
$10=2*5$
$11 = 11$
$12 = 2*2*3$
...
One approach: Find the smallest prime factor of n, then divide by it
$858 = 2*429 = 2*3*143=2*3*11*13$

WRite programs -> effective way
say whatever function is wanted, and then write the function

Generalizing Patterns with Arguments
 Regular geometric shapes relate lengths and area.
 Shape: $r^2, \pi\times r^2 , 3\times \sqrt(3)/2r^2$
FInding common structure allows for shared implementation -> No need to repeat oneself
So using term(k), or term(whatever), then writing k
