Vocab: Expressions and Values
Statements:
- Every expression will evaluate to a value.
- Statements do not evluate to values but modify the flow of the program
- 	Assignment statements
- 	if statneemtns(conditional statements)
- 	def statements
- 	while loops

- Can't exactly print or return a statement
- Later on, we'll run into some expressions that look similar to statemnets

Control Minilecture
if condition:
	body of code
Check condition -> if expression evaluates to True, execute code inside!

check condition ONLY IF previous if statement's condition was False!
elif -> else if cond

We reach the else if all the previous conditions evaluated to False

Environment Diagrams:
- Environment diagrams are the system we use to keep track of variables/functions and their values.
- We start off in the global frame when we first start a program
	- new frames are opened when we calla  new function
- PythonTutor is very helpful for walking through environemnt diagram q's
