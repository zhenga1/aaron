A fundamental principle known as the **law of the excluded middle** says that, for any proposition P, **either P is true or ¬P is true** (but not both). Thus P ∨ ¬P is always true, regardless of the truth value of P. A propositional form that is always true regardless of the truth values of its variables is called a **tautology**. Conversely, a statement such as P∧ ¬P, which is always false, is called a **contradiction**

If we let P stand for the proposition “3 is odd”, Q stand for “4 is odd”, and R for “4+5 = 49”, what are the values of P∧R, P∨R and ¬Q?
P∧R -> false
P∨R -> True
¬Q -> True
