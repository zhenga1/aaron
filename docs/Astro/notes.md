we have that 
- waves when you send through two holes, you get an interference pattern.

Classic wave pattern
-> Send particles through two holes, 
-> Waves - you get high point low point etc

If you look, then the particle pattern is formed
but if you don't look, the wave pattern is observed

Wheeler's delayed choice -> The electrons can make the choice even after the electron passes through the slit.
How does quantum mechanics actually work

Both properties cannot be measured. If you treat it as a wave(measure momentum), then you don't know its position
Normal matter also behaves both as a partile and as a wave

$\lambda = \frac{h}{mv} \rightarrow = \frac{h}{p}$  This is the wavelength of the waveparticle duality of a mass.

Photons has no rest mass, but energy is $E=hf$
They msut always travel at c
h = Plank's constant = $6.63\times 10^{-34}Js$

Photons of higher energy have higher frequency(f) and shorter wavelength (theta)

wavelenghth is inversely related to frequency
Think about this...
A photon of ultraviolet light has much more energy than radio-wave photon. Hence when traveling through a vaccum, the ultraviolet
light travels a the same speed as the radio-wave photon

Stars - Huge, opaque, luminous balls of gas held together by gravity. About 400 billion stars in the Milky Way Galaxy

Stars emit very hot inner parts, emit continuous radiation ("continuum")
cooler outer layers absorb certain wavelength => Derive chemical composition

Trillions of species on Earth

Stars produced nearly everything in the universe. 

10^-10m is the atom's radius. 10^-15 is the nucleus's radius. 

Electrons cannot absorb part of the photon's energy. It is all or nothing. So therefore, the photons can't absorb 2 photons that add 
up to the energy of a single photon.
* technically, in extremely rare circumstances, 2 photons can be absorbed by a single electron. 

Ephoton = delta E = E4-E2 = hfphoton = hc/lambda(photon)
(difference in energy levels)

Emission of a photon
Emission of photon (excess energy) occurs if electron jumps down to a lower energy level
-> Emission occurs in any direcction(random).
-> Several jumps can occur to various levels.

Imaginary element Sunserium has three energy levels: E=0, E=2, and E=6.

Transition from the lowest energy level to the middle energy level requires a photon from 600nm,, the wavelength of the photon 
absorbed in the transition form the middle energy level to the highest energy level

In addition to the continuum, you will have a deficit of green photons, because a majority would have been absorbed.
The reemission will replenish the originally absorbed photons because
- Reemission will be directed at a random direction
- Reemission may be separate, go through different energy levles, and thereby not reemit the original green photon

Emission spectrum: the spectrum tthat shows all the emission of light from atomic radii, arranged by wavelength

Ionization -> photon has enough energy to leave the atom. 
- Photon is absorbed
- Electron is freed from a bound atom

Don't need a specific delta E to ionize an atom, as long as the photon's E is greater than the atomic binding energy of the atom

Recombination 
- electron is captured
- photons are emitted as electron falls to a lower level.

Ionised, as long as photon energy is greater than the ionization energy
Recapture, recombination -> Can emit any combination of photons.

Each neutral element and ionized element(i.e., one that lost >=1 electron) produces a unique patter of lines (like a fingerprint)
Can identify the elements in the Universe!
(Example: hydrogen atom H)

Trained spectroscopist - that is how they can tell what stars are made of

Its the patterns of the high-resolution spectrum that are important. 

Demo of the experiments that, will show the highh-resultion spectrum, they will collisionally ionise, and will produce emission spectrum.
