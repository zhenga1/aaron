**IV relation of a Capacitor**
![[EpicPen_AuxAG2VKA2.png]]
**Series**: When there is an uninterrupted connection traveling right through the circuit (of resistors)
**Parallel**: When each component in the circuit is connecting the same two nodes.

|| symbol just bascially means a mathematical symbol, which stands for **product over sum**

# Capacitor Equivalnece

Series capacitors:
$C_{eq} = C_1 || C_2 = \frac{C_1\times C_2}{(C_1+C_2)}$
Parallel capacitors:
$C_{eq} = C_1 + C_2$ 

Uninterrupted Connetion = Series capacitors

We see that $C_1$ and $C_2$ are not in series, as there is **no uninterrupted connection**. What that means is that current flowing through $C_1$ does not all go to $C_2$, instead it flows through both $C_2$ and $C_3$.

$I_s = C\cdot \frac{dV_c}{dt} \rightarrow \frac{I_s}{c} = \frac{dV_c}{dt}$
