*Determinant:*
- The determinant is n-dimensional volume(whatever that means in higher dimensions) formed by column vectors ()
Let:
$A = \begin{bmatrix}a&&b\\c&&d\end{bmatrix}$ , and we also have $a_1 = \begin{bmatrix}a \\ c\end{bmatrix}, a_2 = \begin{bmatrix}b\\d\end{bmatrix}$ 
Area of parallelogram = Area (PQRS) - Area

Width of entire square is $a+b$, height is now $c+d$
so basically we have area = $(a+b)\times (c+d) - (ac + 2\times bc + bd)$
$=(ac+bc+ad+bd)-(ac+2bc+bd) = ad-bc$
