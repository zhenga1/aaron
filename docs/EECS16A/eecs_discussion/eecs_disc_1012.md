**Voltmeter and Ammeter**
Voltmeter measures voltage drop across elements of interest within circuit.
- In order to do this, we must place voltage in parallel with element of interest such taht it touches the same nodes as element. 
- Ideally, we want our voltmeter to have no current flowing through it so that it does not mess with rest of circuit and only measures a voltage drop
	- We can achieve this by designing our voltmeter to have (nearly) infinite input resistance so that no current flows through it
	- Behaves as an open circuit.
Voltmeters behave as open circuit with infinite resistance, ammeter behave as closed circuit with zero resistance(ideal wire)

**Total power within a circuit is always zero**
Current from left to right labeling, and up to down labeling(so its to ground)

Whatever is connected to **GND** *in a voltage divider circuit* is **==ALWAYS==** the one that goes to the voltage divider equation numerator.
