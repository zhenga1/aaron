If we try to fit the data with a polynomial of degree < 4, then the solution will be a worse fit than the quadratic fit we got before:
$\rightarrow$ Intuitively,this because we are trying to fit the data with a smaller set of paraemters (i.e. trying to approximate the data by a coarser model)
	$\rightarrow$ However, we must beware of overfitting! If the degree of the polynomial goes too high, then we will begin overfitting the data, making it a poor model for preduction.
