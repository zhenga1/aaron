1. **Modular Circuit Buffer**
Voltage dividers on their own cannot be combined without altering their behaviour, but op-amps can **preserve behaviour when combined** and thus is **perfect tool for modular circuit design**. 

We would like to implement block diagram below

Combining all three resistors so that:

# Op Amp golden rule
1) $I+ = I- = 0$
2) $U+ = U-$
