The **output voltage** ==does not ==depend on the load resistance RL, since it is **set by the dependent voltage source inside the op-amp**. Remember that a voltage source will provide any amount of current necessary while maintaining its voltage constant. That is the beauty of op-amps: **they provide isolation between stages because of the open circuit at the input and they get rid of the loading effect**, since they can maintain the output voltage constant ***regardless of the load value***.
