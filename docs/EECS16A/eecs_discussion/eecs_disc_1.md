Discussion 4A
Intro to Circuits:
V --> Voltage (Unit: Volt,V)
I --> Current (Unit: Ampere,A)
R --> Resistance (Unit: Ohm,ohm)
-- I --> u1 
left to right -> current
Voltage -> Left to right, higher potential/voltage 
Passive sign convention:
--I--> u1 to V 
Node: An entire section of wire between elemnts
Trick : keep following a wire until you encounter a circuit element 
	- useful when identifying separate nodes in a circuit
Ohm's Law: V=I*R
Voltage is equal to current times resistance

Wire = --(u1) --> u1 = u2 (in terms of voltage)
There is no voltage drop across a wire

Open Circuit
no connection -> Two separate nodes that are not connected. I=0
No current flows through an open circuit

Resistor:
Obeys Ohm's law: V=IR
Voltage source:
Voltage across it is fixed! V=-Vs. I is determined based on the remaining circuit

Voltage drop across the voltage source is going to be equal to the magnitude of the vvoltage
Current Source: Current through it is fixed! I=Is. V is determined based on the remaining circuits

Wire => $u_1 \rightarrow I \rightarrow u_2$
Voltage Source Vs. Voltage across the voltage source is fixed! V=-Vs. 
I is determined based on remaining ciruit. 

From - to +, gained voltage.
From + to -, losing voltage
From + to -, losing voltage
From - to +, gaind voltage.
