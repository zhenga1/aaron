# **Charge Sharing:**
**Recipe of charge sharing:**
1) Label all voltages across capacitors in whichever direction you want, as long as you stay consistent across all phases (+ on top and - on the bottom in phase 1 => + on top and - on bottom in phase 2).
2) Draw the given circuit in each phase, closing and opening phase switches appropriately and keeping polarity chosen for each capacitor in step 1 cconsistent.

**Motivation**

**Floating Node:** Any node that is directly connected to only a capacitor.

The nodes $60V$ is a floating node, so the charge always stays the same since it literally has nowhere to go.
