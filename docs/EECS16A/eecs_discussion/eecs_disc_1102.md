**Checking for negative Feedback**
**Step 1:** zero out all independent sources
*Recall that:*
Zeroing out a Voltage Source:

==**Op-amp golden rules:**==
1. ==**Infinite Input Resistance:**== No current enters the input terminals of an op-amp
	1. $I+ = I- = 0A$ 
2. **==Equivalent input voltages:==** Both terminals of the **op-amp** hold the same voltage
	1. $U- = U+$

Feedback is the process by which a fraction of the output signal, either a voltage or a current, is used as an input. If this feed back fraction is opposite in value or phase (“anti-phase”) to the input signal, then the feedback is said to be **Negative Feedback**, or _degenerative feedback_.
