NO NEED TO SIGN UP TO EECS DISCUSSION SESSIONS
JUST SHOW UP TO WHATEVER

COURSE POLICIES:
our goal is learning!
Syllabus is on the course website: https//eecs16a.org
- You are responsible for reading and following all course policies listed
- Almost as long as the US tax code
	- HW0 is your tax return

ED: edstem.org
- a resource for you to help each other out

Gradescope

HW0 is the first homework that must be done. It is due next friday.

Home work
- Due Fridays 11:59pm, on GradeScope
- We have a HW party! Wednesday 9-11am & Friday 2-4pm, @Woz
- Office hours - almost every hour of the week

You grade we check
- self-grading due Mon 11:59p.m
- Red the rule -> if you are late you do not get the resubmission
- Resubmissions and self-grading due Mon 11:59p.m

CLASS WEEKLY EVENTS
- Attend lecture - best way to keep along
- Attend discussions (MW)
	- Free participation points!
- Lab
	Required!
	Attend at your scheduled time!
	Checkoff during your lab
- Office Hours
	Fculty after class 2:15-3pm
	GSI many
- W9-11am F2-4p.m, @Woz

IF YOU MISS 4 LABS YOU FAIL THE CLASS IMMEDIATELY
DONT MISS LABS
Lab time is 5-8p.m

Learning
- Collaborate and build commnity on Ed/HW party/STudy gorups
- Encourage different perspectives
- Ask for help if struggling

Optional system to match (into) study groups
- Fill out info in HW0
- Chance tto meet new frinds and study mates (will be assigned by the professors and GSIs

Study: the act of texting,eating and watching TV wih an open textbook nearby


Sent is not equal to received. Sonar sounds -> receivved is not really equal to the sent sound.

Cross Correlation
- Fundamental operation for detection / classification
- Used in Radar / Sonar
- Used in GPS
- Used for cellphoen communication
- Used in Convolutional Neural Networks

Some ideas taught in the class
Plant growth rate vs Amoutn of water plant receives

Some ideas taught in class (3)
Plant growth rate
- Can use different linear regression and quadratic regression
Making a measurement of a linear system
No solution that satisfies all three points. (if)

Define an optimality criteria, and then therefore solve for the best solution.
Least squares estiimation 
- Fundamental approach for solving inconsistent sets of linear equations (due to noise and isurbances...)
- Used for regression and preidction
- Applications in Biology, Social sciences, brain-machine interface, and AI

This is 16A:
	External Environment ->
	Sensing ->
	Process data / Make a model / Predict ->
This is 16B:
	Process data / Make a model / Predict ->
	Actuate i.e. take action ->
	External Environment 

Learning Goals:
Not a survey class - rigorous and deep
EECS 16A
- Module 1: introduction to systems
	- How do we collect data ? buidl model?
- Module 2: Introduction to circuits and design
	- How do we use a model to sovle a problem
- Module 3: Introduction to signal processing and machine learning
	- How do we "learn" models from data and make predcitions?

EECS 16B
- Module 4: Advanced circuit design / analysis
- Module 5: Introduction to control and robotics
- Module 6: Intorduction to data analysis and signal processing

16A lab examples
Imaging -> Real world Measurement and then Processing
	Systems of linar equaions
	Matrix analysis
Touch screen -> Real world Measurement and then processing 
	Measuring circuits
	Processing circuits
Positioning -> Real world measurement and processing
	Cross-correlation
	Optimization

EECS 16A and 16B
Opening of all sorts of stuff and the department of EECS
Modeling and problem formulation -> linear algebra -> Learning,control,systems,signal processing
