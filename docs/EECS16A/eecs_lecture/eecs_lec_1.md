Rembrandt discovred X-rays
More information by taking projection from different angles

-> X ray -> One shiner that shines x rays. And another projector which receives X-rays.
computerized tomography
- Shining x-ray in different angles towards a thingy and then learning more information 
about the thingy, and then trying to reconstruct the thingy.

Projections 
Axial slices
Sagittal Slices

You can 3D render slices. 

Computed tomography

Femur of a cow
Shine x-ray through a cow, and we have detector array that detects whatever (x-rays) are left.
Rotate the X-ray array, and then you would have a full image.

Can I reconstruct the cross section with the graph?
Yes
Computed Tomography -> Whole body ingenuity -> Get the data out fast enough. 

Take physics -> The physical world, and use that to be able to create the world (around us)

Each part of the pixels(the whatever meat thing) will attenuate the X-ray signal all the way to the end

The sum of the values of the attenuation coefficients along a line is the value measured by the X-ray detector

Pixel:: one large sensor -> 4 unknowns -> (y is the measurement)

$y=x_1+x_2+x_3+x_4$ -> one equation 4 unknowns
X-ray attenuation of 4 different points
Let $y=1/2$. 
$y_1 = x_1+x_2$
$y_2 = x_3+x_4$
And adding in we have:
$y_3 = x_1+x_3$
$y_4 = x_2+x_4$

This is called a system of linear equations.
Because LINEAR ALGEBRA is what we need to solve it.
