**Example 5: Exponential Regression**
Model : $y = ce^{ax}, e^{\pi\times \sqrt{-1}}$

Is it a linear fit?
NO but it can bbe linearised

New model: 
$\log(y) = \log(c) + a x = b + a x$
Effectively, now there is a linear relationship we can construct and solve for with respect to $(x, \log(y))$ 

Knowns:  $(x_1, \log(y_1)), (x_2, \log(y_2)) \cdot (x_N, \log(y_N))$

So basically what you do is you wait for whenever the model order selection is correct, you wait for whenever the test error stops going down upon more training.
