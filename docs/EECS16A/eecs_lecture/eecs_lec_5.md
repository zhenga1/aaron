EECS 16A 
Designing information devices and Systems I

Real world --> [[ Sensors --> (Electrical Signals) Processing ]] --> Information
All kinds of sensors exist in the real world, which produce signals.

Module 2- More tools to build systems
Analog World, Sensor, Processing, Actuation
Measurements -> Accuracy in the measurement -> Stick the thermometer in skin.

Actuation -> 16B. After you process the data, the next step would be -
The actuation will be, air conditioning will come on, and teh device will blow cold air ... to a certain temperature.
Then the air conditioning turns on..

System Example - Electromyography
- Monitors muscle activity
- Used in gesture recognition
- Impact in rehabilitation

Bad parts about it
- Bulky electrodes
- Poor accuracy - low resolution
- Computation performed on external devices

Very fine muscles that are responsible for your mobility
Elecctrodes ar every bulky, accuracy of the electrodes are very low

System example - Electromyography.
Scientist/Engineer mixing silver and 

TEAM was able to define 16 movements in the hand very precisely
Taking fthis class requires both hardware and software. You are going to learn how to analyse circuits.
Here the metabiology is a bit different in high school, and what is used in circuit classes later. 

Class (Intro to electrical engineering
Hopes -> Build gigantic machinery
Reality -> Designing (software) to do circuitry

Electrons are very important for electriical devices, as they are the only thing that can move, which 
can create CURRENT. 

SOme electrons give radiation

Electronic devices depned on movement of charge

What are the electrical quantities(properties we know).
Current -> Flow of electrons -> I -> Ampere(Amp)
Voltage(Electric potential) -> Force pushing the electrons -> V -> Volts(V)
Resistance R --> Units is Ohms(ohm) -> Opposition to the flow of electrons

Diode -> only allows current in one direction
With lines -> We have no current devices or large current devices

You can have a wire that is connected to a voltage source.
Velem = 0
I elem = ?
Current is set by the external circuit. You can connect a live wire (a current running through it)
and there will be current but there won't be any voltage. (Just like a wire, wire has no difference (voltage) across
but it has current)

I elem = 0
Velem = ?
Determined by external sources. Open circuit has zero current but may have some vvoltage.


Voltage
Voltage source = Vs
Ielem = ?
( elem set by ext. circuit)

Use transistors, or diodes, or solar cells. 

I element = Is
Vel = ? (No one knows, cuz its set by the external circuit).
Voltage and current can both be negative... it depends on the directionality

Electronic box.
A circuit diagram can have many nodes and junctions

Nodes: point where elements meet
-> whenever one elemenet meets another element, that is a node
Junction: point where different materials meet. -> when materials + wire, that is one junction.
WIre = Copper + plastics -> Junction
Diodes -> P, N, etc, -> Junction

Voltage is difference in electrical potential  
There are 4 nodes

In a matrix A such that we can have A*x = 0, we must have
Row = measurement(each)
Column = variable(each)

Range = Column space = span
