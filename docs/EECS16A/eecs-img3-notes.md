Noise is any unwanted, random variation in our measurement; for example, additional room light getting into our projector boxes to further brighten the image is noise. If there is too much noise in the system, it makes it very hard to distinguish between the actual signal and the noise. We ideally want high signal and low noise in our measurements. A measure of a systemâ€™s perturbation by noise is the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). A high SNR is extremely desirable in any physical system.
