SIL(software in the loop): is a software simulation tool that allows us to run our firmware intended for hardware, without the hardware

For every 30 feet climbed, the pressure is going to drop by 1 hectopascal = 10^2. 

QNH: Local pressure at (for example) the airport of departure

QNH -Â **The pressure set on the subscale of the altimeter so that the instrument indicates its height above sea level**.

So basically since the earth has different air pressures at different points, we see that the QNH would be slightly different at different airports.

We don't need to know the reference pressure at all times. 
Air Traffic Control(ATC): Basically everytime aircraft gets close to an altitutde, they always get a QNH

Hectopascal = 10^2 pascal

However, altitude during flight is also somewhat important to know, since two aircraft could be exactly the same altitude and risk hitting into each other but not know, due to the difference in QNH of the starting airports.

**Solution:** Above a fixed **transition altitude**, all aircraft will set the same QNH so that the vertical separation will be guaranteed between two aircraft.

This **transition altitude** is 20,000 feet. Above that, all altimeterss set their QNH to the standard, which is 1013hPa

A **transition altitude** is where you set the altimeter to standard when climbing. A **transition LEVEL**, on the other hand, is the lowest altitude you may fly in cruise using the STD altimeter setting.

In other words, QNH is specific to each location and each point, which will give you **exact** height above ground. Flight Level, when put into altimeter, will give you difference in height 

**Synchronus Signal**
A signal is in sync with another signal.
