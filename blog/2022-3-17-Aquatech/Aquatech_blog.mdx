## Overview
**Aquatech** is a simple environmental protection app which aims to help in the effort of protecting and maintaining Hong Kong's beaches. It was made
as part of a Hackathon project involving 3 people, myself included. 

**Aquatech** serves as both a water-quality informational service and a water-quality monitering service. Our app contains initial data on 3 Hong Kong beaches' water quality, namely Repulse Bay, Ma On Shan, and Mui Wo beach, which our team measured using our sensors which capture conductivity, PH and temperature data. 
We also enable users to share data that they collect with others through this app.

Our app is available for download here:

### What I Learnt
I learnt more about developing Android applications. I also learnt about databasing, and how to enable different users to share data with each other. Moreover, I learnt more about UI, UX, and how to make good user interfaces.
